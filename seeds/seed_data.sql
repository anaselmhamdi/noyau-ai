AWS Weekly Roundup: 10,000 AIdeas Competition, Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS Managed Instances and more (January 5, 2026)	Prasad Rao	2026-01-05 17:10:37	2026-01-11 01:42:14.756936	Happy New Year! I hope the holidays gave you time to recharge and spend time with your loved ones. Like every year, I took a few weeks off after AWS re:Invent to rest and plan ahead. I used some of that downtime to plan the next cohort for Become a Solutions Architect (BeSA) . BeSA is a free mentoring program that I, along with a few other Amazon Web Services (AWS) employees, volunteer to host as a way to help people excel in their cloud and AI careers. We’re kicking off a 6-week cohort on “Agentic AI on AWS” starting February 21, 2026. Visit the BeSA website to learn more. There is still time to submit your idea for the Global 10,000 AIdeas Competition and compete for $250,000 in cash prizes, AWS credits, and recognition, including potential featured placement at AWS re:Invent 2026 and across AWS channels. You will gain hands-on experience with next-generation AI development tools, connect with innovators globally, and access technical enablement through biweekly workshops, AWS User Groups, and AWS Builder Center resources. The deadline is January 21, 2026, and no code is required yet. If you’re selected as a semifinalist, you’ll build your app then.

As usual, we have you covered with our top announcements of AWS re:Invent 2025 that you can learn all about here. For me, one moment stood out above all the technical announcements: watching Rafi (Raphael Francis Quisumbing) from the Philippines receive the Now Go Build Award from Werner Vogels . Rafi has been an AWS Hero since 2015 and co-lead of AWS User Group Philippines since 2013. His dedication to building communities and empowering developers across the region embodies what this award represents. You can read more about Rafi on The Kernel . Congrats, Rafi! The keynote recap: Agents, renaissance, and the developer’s role This year’s AWS re:Invent keynotes painted a clear picture of where we’re headed. Matt Garman emphasized that developers are “the heart of AWS” and that “freedom to invent” remains AWS’s core mission after 20 years. He focused on AI agents as the next inflection point: “AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf. This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.” Swami Sivasubramanian highlighted the transformative moment we’re in: “For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution.” AWS is building production-ready infrastructure that’s secure, reliable, and scalable—purpose-built for the non-deterministic nature of agents. Peter DeSantis and Dave Brown reinforced that the core attributes AWS has obsessed over for 20 years—security, availability, performance, elasticity, cost, and agility—are more important than ever in the AI era. Dave Brown showcased Graviton and AWS’s...	\N

Traditional approaches force a choice between poor performance with smaller models or the high costs of deploying larger model variants and managing complex infrastructure. Reinforcement fine-tuning is an advanced technique that trains models using feedback instead of massive labeled datasets, but implementing it typically requires specialized ML expertise, complicated infrastructure, and significant investment—with no guarantee of achieving the accuracy needed for specific use cases. Today, we’re announcing reinforcement fine-tuning in Amazon Bedrock , a new model customization capability that creates smarter, more cost-effective models that learn from feedback and deliver higher-quality outputs for specific business needs. Reinforcement fine-tuning uses a feedback-driven approach where models improve iteratively based on reward signals, delivering 66% accuracy gains on average over base models. Amazon Bedrock automates the reinforcement fine-tuning workflow, making this advanced model customization technique accessible to everyday developers without requiring deep machine learning (ML) expertise or large labeled datasets. How reinforcement fine-tuning works Reinforcement fine-tuning is built on top of reinforcement learning principles to address a common challenge: getting models to consistently produce outputs that align with business requirements and user preferences. While traditional fine-tuning requires large, labeled datasets and expensive human annotation, reinforcement fine-tuning takes a different approach. Instead of learning from fixed examples, it uses reward functions to evaluate and judge which responses are considered good for particular business use cases. This teaches models to understand what makes a quality response...	\N

Checkpointless training – Checkpointless training eliminates disruptive checkpoint-restart cycles, maintaining forward training momentum despite failures, reducing recovery time from hours to minutes. Accelerate your AI model development, reclaim days from development timelines, and confidently scale training workflows to thousands of AI accelerators. Elastic training – Elastic training maximizes cluster utilization as training workloads automatically expand to use idle capacity as it becomes available, and contract to yield resources as higher-priority workloads like inference volumes peak. Save hours of engineering time per week spent reconfiguring training jobs based on compute availability. Rather than spending time managing training infrastructure, these new training techniques mean that your team can concentrate entirely on enhancing model performance, ultimately getting your AI models to market faster. By eliminating the traditional checkpoint dependencies and fully utilizing available capacity, you can significantly reduce model training completion times. Checkpointless training: How it works Traditional checkpoint-based recovery has these sequential job stages: 1) job termination and restart, 2) process discovery and network setup, 3) checkpoint retrieval, 4) data loader initialization, and 5) training loop resumption. When failures occur, each stage can become a bottleneck and training recovery can take up to an hour on self-managed training clusters. The entire cluster must wait for every single stage to complete before training can resume. This can lead to the entire training cluster sitting idle during recovery...	\N

Organizations working with tabular data face two common challenges. First, they need to manually manage storage costs as their datasets grow and access patterns change over time. Second, when maintaining replicas of Iceberg tables across Regions or accounts, they must build and maintain complex architectures to track updates, manage object replication, and handle metadata transformations. S3 Tables Intelligent-Tiering storage class With the S3 Tables Intelligent-Tiering storage class , data is automatically tiered to the most cost-effective access tier based on access patterns. Data is stored in three low-latency tiers: Frequent Access, Infrequent Access (40% lower cost than Frequent Access), and Archive Instant Access (68% lower cost compared to Infrequent Access). After 30 days without access, data moves to Infrequent Access, and after 90 days, it moves to Archive Instant Access. This happens without changes to your applications or impact on performance. Table maintenance activities, including compaction, snapshot expiration, and unreferenced file removal, operate without affecting the data’s access tiers. Compaction automatically processes only data in the Frequent Access tier, optimizing performance for actively queried data while reducing maintenance costs by skipping colder files in lower-cost tiers. By default, all existing tables use the Standard storage class. When creating new tables, you can specify Intelligent-Tiering as the storage class, or you can rely on the default storage class configured at the table bucket level. You can set Intelligent-Tiering as the default storage class for your table bucket to automatically store tables...	\N

With the addition of performance metrics, support for analyzing billions of prefixes, and direct export to Amazon S3 Tables, you have the tools you need to optimize application performance, reduce costs, and make data-driven decisions about your Amazon S3 storage strategy. New performance metric categories S3 Storage Lens now includes eight new performance metric categories that help identify and resolve performance constraints across your organization. These are available at organization, account, bucket, and prefix levels. For example, the service helps you identify small objects in a bucket or prefix that can slow down application performance. This can be mitigated by batching small objects or using the Amazon S3 Express One Zone storage class for higher performance small object workloads. To access the new performance metrics, you need to enable performance metrics in the S3 Storage Lens advanced tier when creating a new Storage Lens dashboard or editing an existing configuration.

Organizations across industries are already building on AgentCore, the most advanced agentic platform to build, deploy, and operate highly capable agents securely at any scale. In just 5 months since preview, the AgentCore SDK has been downloaded over 2 million times. For example: PGA TOUR, a pioneer and innovation leader in sports has built a multi-agent content generation system to create articles for their digital platforms. The new solution, built on AgentCore, enables the PGA TOUR to provide comprehensive coverage for every player in the field, by increasing content writing speed by 1,000 percent while achieving a 95 percent reduction in costs. Independent software vendors (ISVs) like Workday are building the software of the future on AgentCore. AgentCore Code Interpreter provides Workday Planning Agent with secure data protection and essential features for financial data exploration. Users can analyze financial and operational data through natural language queries, making financial planning intuitive and self-driven. This capability reduces time spent on routine planning analysis by 30 percent, saving approximately 100 hours per month. Grupo Elfa, a Brazilian distributor and retailer, relies on AgentCore Observability for complete audit traceability and real-time metrics of their agents, transforming their reactive processes into proactive operations. Using this unified platform, their sales team can handle thousands of daily price quotes while the organization maintains full visibility of agent decisions, helping achieve 100 percent traceability of agent decisions and interactions, and reduced problem resolution time by 50 percent. As organizations scale their agent deployments, they face challenges around implementing the right boundaries and quality checks to confidently deploy agents. The autonomy that makes agents...	\N

Building these traditionally required significant effort to implement state management, handle failures, and integrate multiple infrastructure services. Starting today, you can use AWS Lambda durable functions to build reliable multi-step applications directly within the familiar AWS Lambda experience. Durable functions are regular Lambda functions with the same event handler and integrations you already know. You write sequential code in your preferred programming language, and durable functions track progress, automatically retry on failures, and suspend execution for up to one year at defined points, without paying for idle compute during waits. AWS Lambda durable functions use a checkpoint and replay mechanism, known as durable execution, to deliver these capabilities. After enabling a function for durable execution, you add the new open source durable execution SDK to your function code. You then use SDK primitives like “steps” to add automatic checkpointing and retries to your business logic and “waits” to efficiently suspend execution without compute charges. When execution terminates unexpectedly, Lambda resumes from the last checkpoint, replaying your event handler from the beginning while skipping completed operations. Getting started with AWS Lambda durable functions Let me walk you through how to use durable functions. First, I create a new Lambda function in the console and select Author from scratch . In the Durable execution section, I select Enable . Note that, durable function setting can only be set during function creation and currently can’t be modified for existing Lambda functions. After I create my Lambda durable function, I can get started with the provided code. Lambda durable functions introduces two core primitives that handle state...	\N

The key takeaway ? Always upgrade to etcd v3.5.26 or later before moving to v3.6. This ensures your cluster is automatically repaired, and avoids zombie members. Issue summary Recently, the etcd community addressed an issue that may appear when users upgrade from v3.5 to v3.6 . This bug can cause the cluster to report "zombie members", which are etcd nodes that were removed from the database cluster some time ago, and are re-appearing and joining database consensus. The etcd cluster is then inoperable until these zombie members are removed. In etcd v3.5 and earlier, the v2store was the source of truth for membership data, even though the v3store was also present. As a part of our v2store deprecation plan , in v3.6 the v3store is the source of truth for cluster membership. Through a bug report we found out that, in some older clusters, v2store and v3store could become inconsistent. This inconsistency manifests after upgrading as seeing old, removed "zombie" cluster members re-appearing in the cluster. The fix and upgrade path We’ve added a mechanism in etcd v3.5.26 to automatically sync v3store from v2store, ensuring that affected clusters are repaired before upgrading to 3.6.x. To support the many users currently upgrading to 3.6, we have provided the following safe upgrade path: Upgrade your cluster to v3.5.26 or later. Wait and confirm that all members are healthy post-update. Upgrade to v3.6. We are unable to provide a safe workaround path for users who have some obstacle preventing updating to v3.5.26. As such, if v3.5.26 is not available from your packaging source or vendor, you should delay upgrading to v3.6 until it is. Additional technical detail Information below is offered for reference only. Users can follow the safe upgrade path without knowledge of the following details. This issue is encountered with clusters that have been running in production on etcd...	\N

Organizations need flexible options across their entire database lifecycle, spanning development, testing, and production workloads with diverse storage and compute requirements. To address these needs, we’re announcing four new capabilities for Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) to help customers optimize their costs as well as improve efficiency and scalability for their Amazon RDS for Oracle and Amazon RDS for SQL Server databases. These enhancements include SQL Server Developer Edition support and expanded storage capabilities for both RDS for Oracle and RDS for SQL Server. Additionally, you can have CPU optimization options for RDS for SQL Server on M7i and R7i instances, which offer price reductions from previous generation instances and separately billed licensing fees. Let’s explore what’s new. SQL Server Developer Edition support SQL Server Developer Edition is now available on RDS for SQL Server, offering a free SQL Server edition that includes all the Enterprise Edition functionalities. Developer Edition is licensed specifically for non-production workloads, so you can build and test applications without incurring SQL Server licensing costs in your development and testing environments.

Today, we’re extending this flexible pricing model to AWS managed database services with the launch of Database Savings Plans, which help customers reduce database costs by up to 35% when they commit to a consistent amount of usage ($/hour) over a 1-year term. Savings automatically apply each hour to eligible usage across supported database services, and any additional usage beyond the commitment is billed at on-demand rates. As organizations build and manage data-driven and AI applications, they often use different database services, engines and deployment types, including instance-based and serverless options, to meet evolving business needs. Database Savings Plans provide the flexibility to choose how workloads run while maintaining cost efficiency. If customers are in the middle of a migration or modernization effort, they can switch database engines and adjust deployment types, such as from provisioned to serverless as part of ongoing cost optimization, while continuing to receive discounted rates. If a customer’s business expands globally, they can also shift usage across AWS Regions and continue to benefit from the same commitment. By applying a consistent hourly commitment, customers can maintain predictable spend even as usage patterns evolve and analyze coverage and utilization using familiar cost management tools.

Here are the new capabilities introduced today: GPU acceleration – You can build vector databases up to 10 times faster at a quarter of the indexing cost when compared to non-GPU acceleration, and you can create billion-scale vector databases in under an hour. With significant gains in cost saving and speed, you get an advantage in time-to-market, innovation velocity, and adoption of vector search at scale. Auto-optimization – You can find the best balance between search latency, quality, and memory requirements for your vector field without needing vector expertise. This optimization helps you achieve better cost-savings and recall rates when compared to default index configurations, while manual index tuning can take weeks to complete. You can use these capabilities to build vector databases faster and more cost-effectively on OpenSearch Service. You can use them to power generative AI applications, search product catalogs and knowledge bases, and more. You can enable GPU acceleration and auto-optimization when you create a new OpenSearch domain or collection, as well as update an existing domain or collection. Let’s go through how it works! GPU acceleration for vector index When you enable GPU acceleration on your OpenSearch Service domain or Serverless collection, OpenSearch Service automatically detects opportunities to accelerate your vector indexing workloads. This acceleration helps build the vector data structures in your OpenSearch Service domain or Serverless collection. You don’t need to provision the GPU instances, manage their usage or pay for idle time. OpenSearch Service securely isolates your accelerated workloads to your domain’s or collection’s Amazon...	\N

S3 Vectors is the first cloud object storage with native support to store and query vector data. You can use it to help you reduce the total cost of storing and querying vectors by up to 90% when compared to specialized vector database solutions. Since we announced the preview of S3 Vectors in July , I’ve been impressed by how quickly you adopted this new capability to store and query vector data. In just over four months, you created over 250,000 vector indexes and ingested more than 40 billion vectors, performing over 1 billion queries (as of November 28th). You can now store and search across up to 2 billion vectors in a single index, that’s up to 20 trillion vectors in a vector bucket and a 40x increase from 50 million per index during preview. This means that you can consolidate your entire vector dataset into one index, removing the need to shard across multiple smaller indexes or implement complex query federation logic. Query performance has been optimized. Infrequent queries continue to return results in under one second, with more frequent queries now resulting in latencies around 100ms or less, making it well-suited for interactive applications such as conversational AI and multi-agent workflows. You can also retrieve up to 100 search results per query, up from 30 previously, providing more comprehensive context for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications. The write performance has also improved substantially, with support for up to 1,000 PUT transactions per second when streaming single-vector updates into your indexes, delivering significantly higher write throughput for small batch sizes. This higher throughput supports workloads where new data must be immediately searchable, helping you ingest small data corpora quickly or handle many concurrent sources writing simultaneously to...	\N

These instances offer the highest CPU frequency, 5GHz in the cloud. They deliver up to two times higher compute performance compared to previous generation X2iezn instances. X8aedz instances are ideal for electronic design automation (EDA) workloads, such as physical layout and physical verification jobs, and relational databases that benefit from high single-threaded processor performance and a large memory footprint. The combination of 5 GHz processors and local NVMe storage enables faster processing of memory-intensive backend EDA workloads such as floor planning, logic placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), routing, and power/signal integrity analysis. The high memory-to-vCPU ratio of 32:1 makes these instances particularly effective for applications with vCPU-based licensing models. Let me explain the instance type naming: The “a” suffix indicates an AMD processor, “e” denotes extended memory in the memory-optimized instance family, “d” represents local NVMe-based SSDs physically connected to the host server, and “z” indicates high-frequency processors. X8aedz instances X8aedz instances are available in eight sizes ranging from 2–96 vCPUs with 64–3,072 GiB of memory, including two bare metal sizes. X8aedz instances feature up to 75 Gbps of network bandwidth with support for the Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) , up to 60 Gbps of throughput to the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) , and up to 8 TB of local NVMe SSD storage.

Frontier agents represent a new class of AI agents that are autonomous, massively scalable, and work for hours or days without constant intervention. When production incidents occur, on-call engineers face significant pressure to quickly identify root causes while managing stakeholder communications. They must analyze data across multiple monitoring tools, review recent deployments, and coordinate response teams. After service restoration, teams often lack bandwidth to transform incident learnings into systematic improvements. AWS DevOps Agent is your always-on, autonomous on-call engineer. When issues arise, it automatically correlates data across your operational toolchain, from metrics and logs to recent code deployments in GitHub or GitLab. It identifies probable root causes and recommends targeted mitigations, helping reduce mean time to resolution. The agent also manages incident coordination, using Slack channels for stakeholder updates and maintaining detailed investigation timelines. To get started, you connect AWS DevOps Agent to your existing tools through the AWS Management Console . The agent works with popular services such as Amazon CloudWatch , Datadog , Dynatrace , New Relic , and Splunk for observability data, while integrating with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD to track deployments and their impact on your cloud resources. Through the bring your own (BYO) Model Context Protocol (MCP) server capability, you can also integrate additional tools such as your organization’s custom tools, specialized platforms or open source observability solutions, such as Grafana and Prometheus into your investigations.

Building on this foundation, we’re continuing to evolve the MLflow experience to make experimentation even more accessible. Today, I’m excited to announce that Amazon SageMaker AI with MLflow now includes a serverless capability that eliminates infrastructure management. This new MLflow capability transforms experiment tracking into an immediate, on-demand experience with automatic scaling that removes the need for capacity planning. The shift to zero-infrastructure management fundamentally changes how teams approach AI experimentation—ideas can be tested immediately without infrastructure planning, enabling more iterative and exploratory development workflows. Getting started with Amazon SageMaker AI and MLflow Let me walk you through creating your first serverless MLflow instance. I navigate to Amazon SageMaker AI Studio console and select the MLflow application. The term MLflow Apps replaces the previous MLflow tracking servers terminology, reflecting the simplified, application-focused approach. Here, I can see there’s already a default MLflow App created. This simplified MLflow experience makes it more straightforward for me to start doing experiments. I choose Create MLflow App , and enter a name. Here, I have both an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and Amazon Simple Service (Amazon S3) bucket are already been configured. I only need to modify them in Advanced settings if needed. Here’s where the first major improvement becomes apparent—the creation process completes in approximately 2 minutes. This immediate availability enables rapid experimentation without infrastructure planning delays, eliminating the wait time that previously interrupted experimentation workflows. After it’s created, I receive an MLflow Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for connecting from...	\N

Whenever you download or auto-generate a kubeconfig , the users[n].exec.command field can specify an executable to fetch credentials on your behalf. Don't get me wrong, this is an incredible feature that allows you to authenticate to the cluster with external identity providers. Nevertheless, you probably see the problem: Do you know exactly what executables your kubeconfig is running on your system? Do you trust the pipeline that generated your kubeconfig ? If there has been a supply-chain attack on the code that generates the kubeconfig, or if the generating pipeline has been compromised, an attacker might well be doing unsavory things to your machine by tricking your kubeconfig into running arbitrary code. To give the user more control over what gets run on their system, SIG-Auth and SIG-CLI added the credential plugin policy and allowlist as a beta feature to Kubernetes 1.35. This is available to all clients using the client-go library, by filling out the ExecProvider.PluginPolicy struct on a REST config. To broaden the impact of this change, Kubernetes v1.35 also lets you manage this without writing a line of application code. You can configure kubectl to enforce the policy and allowlist by adding two fields to the kuberc configuration file: credentialPluginPolicy and credentialPluginAllowlist . Adding one or both of these fields restricts which credential plugins kubectl is allowed to execute. How it works A full description of this functionality is available in our official documentation for kuberc, but this blog post will give a brief overview of the new security knobs. The new features are in beta and available without using any feature gates. The following example is the simplest one: simply don't specify the new fields. apiVersion : kubectl.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind : Preference This will keep...	\N

It is widely used to express that volumes may not be equally accessible by all nodes in the cluster. This field was previously immutable, and it is now mutable in Kubernetes v1.35 (alpha). This change opens a door to more flexible online volume management. Why make node affinity mutable? This raises an obvious question: why make node affinity mutable now? While stateless workloads like Deployments can be changed freely and the changes will be rolled out automatically by re-creating every Pod, PersistentVolumes (PVs) are stateful and cannot be re-created easily without losing data. However, Storage providers evolve and storage requirements change. Most notably, multiple providers are offering regional disks now. Some of them even support live migration from zonal to regional disks, without disrupting the workloads. This change can be expressed through the VolumeAttributesClass API, which recently graduated to GA in 1.34. However, even if the volume is migrated to regional storage, Kubernetes still prevents scheduling Pods to other zones because of the node affinity recorded in the PV object. In this case, you may want to change the PV node affinity from: spec : nodeAffinity : required : nodeSelectorTerms : - matchExpressions : - key : topology.kubernetes.io/zone operator : In values : - us-east1-b to: spec : nodeAffinity : required : nodeSelectorTerms : - matchExpressions : - key : topology.kubernetes.io/region operator : In values : - us-east1 As another example, providers sometimes offer new generations of disks. New disks cannot always be attached to older nodes in the cluster. This accessibility can also be expressed through PV node affinity and ensures the Pods can be scheduled to the right nodes. But when the disk is upgraded, new Pods using this disk can still be scheduled to older nodes. To prevent this, you may want to change the PV node affinity from: spec : nodeAffinity : required :...	\N

Since the introduction of the TokenRequests feature , service account tokens requested by CSI drivers have been passed to them through the volume_context field. While this has worked, it's not the ideal place for sensitive information, and we've seen instances where tokens were accidentally logged in CSI drivers. Kubernetes v1.35 introduces a beta solution to address this: CSI Driver Opt-in for Service Account Tokens via Secrets Field . This allows CSI drivers to receive service account tokens through the secrets field in NodePublishVolumeRequest , which is the appropriate place for sensitive data in the CSI specification. Understanding the existing approach When CSI drivers use the TokenRequests feature , they can request service account tokens for workload identity by configuring the TokenRequests field in the CSIDriver spec. These tokens are passed to drivers as part of the volume attributes map, using the key csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens . The volume_context field works, but it's not designed for sensitive data. Because of this, there are a few challenges: First, the protosanitizer tool that CSI drivers use doesn't treat volume context as sensitive, so service account tokens can end up in logs when gRPC requests are logged. This happened with CVE-2023-2878 in the Secrets Store CSI Driver and CVE-2024-3744 in the Azure File CSI Driver. Second, each CSI driver that wants to avoid this issue needs to implement its own sanitization logic, which leads to inconsistency across drivers. The CSI specification already has a secrets field in NodePublishVolumeRequest that's designed exactly for this kind of sensitive information. The challenge is that we can't just change where we put the tokens without breaking existing CSI drivers that expect them in volume context.

Platform teams need a safe default that keeps most workloads away from risky capacity, while allowing specific workloads to opt-in with explicit thresholds like "I can tolerate nodes with failure probability up to 5%". Today, Kubernetes taints and tolerations can match exact values or check for existence, but they can't compare numeric thresholds. You'd need to create discrete taint categories, use external admission controllers, or accept less-than-optimal placement decisions. In Kubernetes v1.35, we're introducing Extended Toleration Operators as an alpha feature. This enhancement adds Gt (Greater Than) and Lt (Less Than) operators to spec.tolerations , enabling threshold-based scheduling decisions that unlock new possibilities for SLA-based placement, cost optimization, and performance-aware workload distribution. The evolution of tolerations Historically, Kubernetes supported two primary toleration operators: Equal : The toleration matches a taint if the key and value are exactly equal Exists : The toleration matches a taint if the key exists, regardless of value While these worked well for categorical scenarios, they fell short for numeric comparisons. Starting with v1.35, we are closing this gap. Consider these real-world scenarios: SLA requirements : Schedule high-availability workloads only on nodes with failure probability below a certain threshold Cost optimization : Allow cost-sensitive batch jobs to run on cheaper nodes that exceed a specific cost-per-hour value Performance guarantees : Ensure latency-sensitive applications run only on nodes with disk IOPS or network bandwidth above minimum thresholds Without numeric comparison operators, cluster operators have had to resort to workarounds like creating multiple discrete taint values or using external admission controllers,...	\N

This feature, Restart All Containers (alpha in 1.35), allows for an efficient way to reset a Pod's state compared to resource-intensive approach of deleting and recreating the entire Pod. This feature is especially useful for AI/ML workloads allowing application developers to concentrate on their core training logic while offloading complex failure-handling and recovery mechanisms to sidecars and declarative Kubernetes configuration. With RestartAllContainers and other planned enhancements, Kubernetes continues to add building blocks for creating the most flexible, robust, and efficient platforms for AI/ML workloads. This new functionality is available by enabling the RestartAllContainersOnContainerExits feature gate. This alpha feature extends the Container Restart Rules feature , which graduated to beta in Kubernetes 1.35. The problem: when a single container restart isn't enough and recreating pods is too costly Kubernetes has long supported restart policies at the Pod level ( restartPolicy ) and, more recently, at the individual container level . These policies are great for handling crashes in a single, isolated process. However, many modern applications have more complex inter-container dependencies. For instance: An init container prepares the environment by mounting a volume or generating a configuration file. If the main application container corrupts this environment, simply restarting that one container is not enough. The entire initialization process needs to run again. A watcher sidecar monitors system health. If it detects an unrecoverable but retriable error state, it must trigger a restart of the main application container from a clean slate. A sidecar that manages a remote resource fails. Even if the sidecar restarts on its own, the main container may be stuck trying to access an...	\N

With Kubernetes 1.35, we're enhancing the z-pages debugging endpoints with structured, machine-parseable responses that make it easier to build tooling and automate troubleshooting workflows. What are z-pages? z-pages are special debugging endpoints exposed by Kubernetes control plane components. Introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.32, these endpoints provide runtime diagnostics for components like kube-apiserver , kube-controller-manager , kube-scheduler , kubelet and kube-proxy . The name "z-pages" comes from the convention of using /*z paths for debugging endpoints. Currently, Kubernetes supports two primary z-page endpoints: /statusz Displays high-level component information including version information, start time, uptime, and available debug paths /flagz Shows all command-line arguments and their values used to start the component (with confidential values redacted for security) These endpoints are valuable for human operators who need to quickly inspect component state, but until now, they only returned plain text output that was difficult to parse programmatically. What's new in Kubernetes 1.35? Kubernetes 1.35 introduces structured, versioned responses for both /statusz and /flagz endpoints. This enhancement maintains backward compatibility with the existing plain text format while adding support for machine-readable JSON responses. Backward compatible design The new structured responses are opt-in. Without specifying an Accept header, the endpoints continue to return the familiar plain text format: $ curl --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt \\ --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver-kubelet-client.key \\ --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt \\ https://localhost:6443/statusz kube-apiserver statusz Warning: This endpoint is not meant to be machine parseable, has...	\N

Following the successful alpha release in Kubernetes v1.33 , Service Account Token Integration for Kubelet Credential Providers has now graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.34, bringing us closer to eliminating long-lived image pull secrets from Kubernetes clusters. This enhancement allows credential providers to use workload-specific service account tokens to obtain registry credentials, providing a secure, ephemeral alternative to traditional image pull secrets. What's new in beta? The beta graduation brings several important changes that make the feature more robust and production-ready: Required cacheType field Breaking change from alpha : The cacheType field is required in the credential provider configuration when using service account tokens. This field is new in beta and must be specified to ensure proper caching behavior. # CAUTION: this is not a complete configuration example, just a reference for the 'tokenAttributes.cacheType' field. tokenAttributes : serviceAccountTokenAudience : "my-registry-audience" cacheType : "ServiceAccount" # Required field in beta requireServiceAccount : true Choose between two caching strategies: Token : Cache credentials per service account token (use when credential lifetime is tied to the token). This is useful when the credential provider transforms the service account token into registry credentials with the same lifetime as the token, or when registries support Kubernetes service account tokens directly. Note: The kubelet cannot send service account tokens directly to registries; credential provider plugins are needed to transform tokens into the username/password format expected by registries.

This causes unnecessary API requests to the cloud provider when there are no changes to routes. Other controllers implemented through the same library already use watch-based mechanisms, leveraging informers to avoid unnecessary API calls. A new feature gate is being introduced in v1.35 to allow changing the behavior of the route controller to use watch-based informers. What's new? The feature gate CloudControllerManagerWatchBasedRoutesReconciliation has been introduced to k8s.io/cloud-provider in alpha stage by SIG Cloud Provider . To enable this feature you can use --feature-gate=CloudControllerManagerWatchBasedRoutesReconciliation=true in the CCM implementation you are using. About the feature gate This feature gate will trigger the route reconciliation loop whenever a node is added, deleted, or the fields .spec.podCIDRs or .status.addresses are updated. An additional reconcile is performed in a random interval between 12h and 24h, which is chosen at the controller's start time. This feature gate does not modify the logic within the reconciliation loop. Therefore, users of a CCM implementation should not experience significant changes to their existing route configurations.

For example, when scheduling a machine learning batch job, you often need to place each worker strategically, such as on the same rack, to make the entire process as efficient as possible. At the same time, the Pods that are part of such a workload are very often identical from the scheduling perspective, which fundamentally changes how this process should look. There are many custom schedulers adapted to perform workload scheduling efficiently, but considering how common and important workload scheduling is to Kubernetes users, especially in the AI era with the growing number of use cases, it is high time to make workloads a first-class citizen for kube-scheduler and support them natively. Workload aware scheduling The recent 1.35 release of Kubernetes delivered the first tranche of workload aware scheduling improvements. These are part of a wider effort that is aiming to improve scheduling and management of workloads. The effort will span over many SIGs and releases, and is supposed to gradually expand capabilities of the system toward reaching the north star goal, which is seamless workload scheduling and management in Kubernetes including, but not limited to, preemption and autoscaling. Kubernetes v1.35 introduces the Workload API that you can use to describe the desired shape as well as scheduling-oriented requirements of the workload. It comes with an initial implementation of gang scheduling that instructs the kube-scheduler to schedule gang Pods in the all-or-nothing fashion. Finally, we improved scheduling of identical Pods (that typically make a gang) to speed up the process thanks to the opportunistic batching feature. Workload API The new Workload API resource is part of the scheduling.k8s.io/v1alpha1 API group . This resource acts as a structured,...	\N

The new Pod field, supplementalGroupsPolicy , was introduced as an opt-in alpha feature for Kubernetes v1.31, and then had graduated to beta in v1.33. Now, the feature is generally available. This feature allows you to implement more precise control over supplemental groups in Linux containers that can strengthen the security posture particularly in accessing volumes. Moreover, it also enhances the transparency of UID/GID details in containers, offering improved security oversight. If you are planning to upgrade your cluster from v1.32 or an earlier version, please be aware that some behavioral breaking change introduced since beta (v1.33). For more details, see the behavioral changes introduced in beta and the upgrade considerations sections of the previous blog for graduation to beta. Motivation: Implicit group memberships defined in /etc/group in the container image Even though the majority of Kubernetes cluster admins/users may not be aware of this, by default Kubernetes merges group information from the Pod with information defined in /etc/group in the container image. Here's an example; a Pod manifest that specifies spec.securityContext.runAsUser: 1000 , spec.securityContext.runAsGroup: 3000 and spec.securityContext.supplementalGroups: 4000 as part of the Pod's security context. apiVersion : v1 kind : Pod metadata : name : implicit-groups-example spec : securityContext : runAsUser : 1000 runAsGroup : 3000 supplementalGroups : [ 4000 ] containers : - name : example-container image : registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.45 command : [ "sh" , "-c" , "sleep 1h" ] securityContext : allowPrivilegeEscalation : false What is the result of id command in the example-container container?

The newly stable feature simplifies the management of kubelet configuration across large, heterogeneous clusters. With v1.35, the kubelet command line argument --config-dir is production-ready and fully supported, allowing you to specify a directory containing kubelet configuration drop-in files. All files in that directory will be automatically merged with your main kubelet configuration. This allows cluster administrators to maintain a cohesive base configuration for kubelets while enabling targeted customizations for different node groups or use cases, and without complex tooling or manual configuration management. The problem: managing kubelet configuration at scale As Kubernetes clusters grow larger and more complex, they often include heterogeneous node pools with different hardware capabilities, workload requirements, and operational constraints. This diversity necessitates different kubelet configurations across node groups—yet managing these varied configurations at scale becomes increasingly challenging. Several pain points emerge: Configuration drift : Different nodes may have slightly different configurations, leading to inconsistent behavior Node group customization : GPU nodes, edge nodes, and standard compute nodes often require different kubelet settings Operational overhead : Maintaining separate, complete configuration files for each node type is error-prone and difficult to audit Change management : Rolling out configuration changes across heterogeneous node pools requires careful coordination Before this support was added to Kubernetes, cluster administrators had to choose between using a single monolithic configuration file for all nodes, manually maintaining multiple complete configuration files, or relying on separate tooling. Each approach had its own drawbacks. This graduation to stable gives cluster administrators a...	\N

This graduation is a major milestone for improving resource efficiency and flexibility for workloads running on Kubernetes. What is in-place Pod Resize? In the past, the CPU and memory resources allocated to a container in a Pod were immutable. This meant changing them required deleting and recreating the entire Pod. For stateful services, batch jobs, or latency-sensitive workloads, this was an incredibly disruptive operation. In-Place Pod Resize makes CPU and memory requests and limits mutable, allowing you to adjust these resources within a running Pod, often without requiring a container restart. Key Concept: Desired Resources: A container's spec.containers[*].resources field now represents the desired resources. For CPU and memory, these fields are now mutable. Actual Resources: The status.containerStatuses[*].resources field reflects the resources currently configured for a running container. Triggering a Resize: You can request a resize by updating the desired requests and limits in the Pod's specification by utilizing the new resize subresource. How can I start using in-place Pod Resize? Detailed usage instructions and examples are provided in the official documentation: Resize CPU and Memory Resources assigned to Containers . How does this help me? In-place Pod Resize is a foundational building block that unlocks seamless, vertical autoscaling and improvements to workload efficiency. Resources adjusted without disruption Workloads sensitive to latency or restarts can have their resources modified in-place without downtime or loss of state. More powerful autoscaling Autoscalers are now empowered to adjust resources and with less impact. For example, Vertical Pod Autoscaler...	\N

This feature allows external controllers to take full responsibility for Job reconciliation, unlocking powerful scheduling patterns like multi-cluster dispatching with MultiKueue . Why delegate Job reconciliation? The primary motivation for this feature is to support multi-cluster batch scheduling architectures, such as MultiKueue. The MultiKueue architecture distinguishes between a Management Cluster and a pool of Worker Clusters: The Management Cluster is responsible for dispatching Jobs but not executing them. It needs to accept Job objects to track status, but it skips the creation and execution of Pods. The Worker Clusters receive the dispatched Jobs and execute the actual Pods. Users usually interact with the Management Cluster. Because the status is automatically propagated back, they can observe the Job's progress "live" without accessing the Worker Clusters. In the Worker Clusters, the dispatched Jobs run as regular Jobs managed by the built-in Job controller, with no .spec.managedBy set. By using .spec.managedBy , the MultiKueue controller on the Management Cluster can take over the reconciliation of a Job. It copies the status from the "mirror" Job running on the Worker Cluster back to the Management Cluster. Why not just disable the Job controller? While one could theoretically achieve this by disabling the built-in Job controller entirely, this is often impossible or impractical for two reasons: Managed Control Planes: In many cloud environments, the Kubernetes control plane is locked, and users cannot modify controller manager flags. Hybrid Cluster Role: Users often need a "hybrid" mode where the Management Cluster dispatches some heavy workloads to remote clusters but still executes smaller or control-plane-related Jobs in the Management Cluster. .spec.managedBy allows this granularity on a per-Job basis.

Release theme and logo 2025 began in the shimmer of Octarine: The Color of Magic (v1.33) and rode the gusts Of Wind & Will (v1.34). We close the year with our hands on the World Tree, inspired by Yggdrasil, the tree of life that binds many realms. Like any great tree, Kubernetes grows ring by ring and release by release, shaped by the care of a global community. At its center sits the Kubernetes wheel wrapped around the Earth, grounded by the resilient maintainers, contributors and users who keep showing up. Between day jobs, life changes, and steady open-source stewardship, they prune old APIs, graft new features and keep one of the world’s largest open source projects healthy. Three squirrels guard the tree: a wizard holding the LGTM scroll for reviewers, a warrior with an axe and Kubernetes shield for the release crews who cut new branches, and a rogue with a lantern for the triagers who bring light to dark issue queues. Together, they stand in for a much larger adventuring party. Kubernetes v1.35 adds another growth ring to the World Tree, a fresh cut shaped by many hands, many paths and a community whose branches reach higher as its roots grow deeper. Spotlight on key updates Kubernetes v1.35 is packed with new features and improvements. Here are a few select updates the Release Team would like to highlight! Stable: In-place update of Pod resources Kubernetes has graduated in-place updates for Pod resources to General Availability (GA)....	\N

Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the project's overall health. This blog post outlines planned changes for the v1.35 release that the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes cluster(s), and to keep you up to date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1.35 release and is subject to change before the final release date. Deprecations and removals for Kubernetes v1.35 cgroup v1 support On Linux nodes, container runtimes typically rely on cgroups (short for "control groups"). Support for using cgroup v2 has been stable in Kubernetes since v1.25, providing an alternative to the original v1 cgroup support. While cgroup v1 provided the initial resource control mechanism, it suffered from well-known inconsistencies and limitations. Adding support for cgroup v2 allowed use of a unified control group hierarchy, improved resource isolation, and served as the foundation for modern features, making legacy cgroup v1 support ready for removal. The removal of cgroup v1 support will only impact cluster administrators running nodes on older Linux distributions that do not support cgroup v2; on those nodes, the kubelet will fail to start. Administrators must migrate their nodes to systems with cgroup v2 enabled. More details on compatibility requirements will be available in a blog post soon after the v1.35 release. To learn more, read about cgroup v2 ; you can also track the switchover work via KEP-5573: Remove cgroup v1 support . Deprecation of ipvs mode in kube-proxy Many releases ago, the Kubernetes project implemented an ipvs mode in kube-proxy . It was adopted as a way to provide high-performance service load balancing, with better performance than the existing iptables mode. However, maintaining feature parity between ipvs and other kube-proxy...	\N

Configuration is at the heart of every Kubernetes workload. A missing quote, a wrong API version or a misplaced YAML indent can ruin your entire deploy. This blog brings together tried-and-tested configuration best practices. The small habits that make your Kubernetes setup clean, consistent and easier to manage. Whether you are just starting out or already deploying apps daily, these are the little things that keep your cluster stable and your future self sane. This blog is inspired by the original Configuration Best Practices page, which has evolved through contributions from many members of the Kubernetes community. General configuration practices Use the latest stable API version Kubernetes evolves fast. Older APIs eventually get deprecated and stop working. So, whenever you are defining resources, make sure you are using the latest stable API version. You can always check with kubectl api-resources This simple step saves you from future compatibility issues. Store configuration in version control Never apply manifest files directly from your desktop. Always keep them in a version control system like Git, it's your safety net. If something breaks, you can instantly roll back to a previous commit, compare changes or recreate your cluster setup without panic. Write configs in YAML not JSON Write your configuration files using YAML rather than JSON. Both work technically, but YAML is just easier for humans. It's cleaner to read and less noisy and widely used in the community. YAML has some sneaky gotchas with boolean values: Use only true or false . Don't write yes , no , on or off . They might work in one version of YAML but break in another. To be safe, quote anything that looks like a Boolean (for example "yes" ). Keep configuration simple and minimal Avoid setting default values that are already handled by Kubernetes. Minimal manifests are easier to debug, cleaner to review and...	\N

Best-effort maintenance will continue until March 2026. Afterward, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will continue to function and installation artifacts will remain available. We recommend migrating to one of the many alternatives. Consider migrating to Gateway API , the modern replacement for Ingress. If you must continue using Ingress, many alternative Ingress controllers are listed in the Kubernetes documentation . Continue reading for further information about the history and current state of Ingress NGINX, as well as next steps. About Ingress NGINX Ingress is the original user-friendly way to direct network traffic to workloads running on Kubernetes. ( Gateway API is a newer way to achieve many of the same goals.) In order for an Ingress to work in your cluster, there must be an Ingress controller running. There are many Ingress controller choices available, which serve the needs of different users and use cases. Some are cloud-provider specific, while others have more general applicability. Ingress NGINX was an Ingress controller, developed early in the history of the Kubernetes project as an example implementation of the API. It became very popular due to its tremendous flexibility, breadth of features, and independence from any particular cloud or infrastructure provider. Since those days, many other Ingress controllers have been created within the Kubernetes project by community groups, and by cloud native vendors. Ingress NGINX has continued to be one of the most popular, deployed as part of many hosted Kubernetes platforms and within innumerable independent users’ clusters.

The Kubernetes SIG Network community presented the General Availability (GA) release of Gateway API (v1.4.0)! Released on October 6, 2025, version 1.4.0 reinforces the path for modern, expressive, and extensible service networking in Kubernetes. Gateway API v1.4.0 brings three new features to the Standard channel (Gateway API's GA release channel): BackendTLSPolicy for TLS between gateways and backends supportedFeatures in GatewayClass status Named rules for Routes and introduces three new experimental features: Mesh resource for service mesh configuration Default gateways to ease configuration burden** externalAuth filter for HTTPRoute Graduations to Standard Channel Backend TLS policy Leads: Candace Holman , Norwin Schnyder , Katarzyna Łach GEP-1897: BackendTLSPolicy BackendTLSPolicy is a new Gateway API type for specifying the TLS configuration of the connection from the Gateway to backend pod(s). . Prior to the introduction of BackendTLSPolicy, there was no API specification that allowed encrypted traffic on the hop from Gateway to backend. The BackendTLSPolicy validation configuration requires a hostname. This hostname serves two purposes. It is used as the SNI header when connecting to the backend and for authentication, the certificate presented by the backend must match this hostname, unless subjectAltNames is explicitly specified. If subjectAltNames (SANs) are specified, the hostname is only used for SNI, and authentication is performed against the SANs instead. If you still need to authenticate against the hostname value in this case, you MUST add it to the subjectAltNames list. BackendTLSPolicy validation configuration also requires either caCertificateRefs or wellKnownCACertificates . caCertificateRefs refer to one or more (up to 8) PEM-encoded TLS certificate bundles. If there are no specific certificates to use, then depending on your implementation, you may use wellKnownCACertificates , set to "System" to...	\N

While powerful quantum computers are still largely theoretical for many applications, their potential to break current cryptographic standards is a serious concern, especially for long-lived systems. This is where Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) comes in. In this article, I'll dive into what PQC means for TLS and, more specifically, for the Kubernetes ecosystem. I'll explain what the (suprising) state of PQC in Kubernetes is and what the implications are for current and future clusters. What is Post-Quantum Cryptography Post-Quantum Cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms that are thought to be secure against attacks by both classical and quantum computers. The primary concern is that quantum computers, using algorithms like Shor's Algorithm , could efficiently break widely used public-key cryptosystems such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which underpin much of today's secure communication, including TLS. The industry is actively working on standardizing and adopting PQC algorithms. One of the first to be standardized by NIST is the Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism ( ML-KEM ), formerly known as Kyber, and now standardized as FIPS-203 (PDF download). It is difficult to predict when quantum computers will be able to break classical algorithms. However, it is clear that we need to start migrating to PQC algorithms now, as the next section shows. To get a feeling for the predicted timeline we can look at a NIST report covering the transition to post-quantum cryptography standards. It declares that system with classical crypto should be deprecated after 2030 and disallowed after 2035. Key exchange vs. digital signatures: different needs, different timelines In TLS, there are two main cryptographic operations we need to secure: Key Exchange : This is how the client and server agree on a shared secret to encrypt their communication.

When I first started dabbling with container orchestration, I made more than my fair share of mistakes enough to compile a whole list of pitfalls. In this post, I want to walk through seven big gotchas I’ve encountered (or seen others run into) and share some tips on how to avoid them. Whether you’re just kicking the tires on Kubernetes or already managing production clusters, I hope these insights help you steer clear of a little extra stress. 1. Skipping resource requests and limits The pitfall : Not specifying CPU and memory requirements in Pod specifications. This typically happens because Kubernetes does not require these fields, and workloads can often start and run without them—making the omission easy to overlook in early configurations or during rapid deployment cycles. Context : In Kubernetes, resource requests and limits are critical for efficient cluster management. Resource requests ensure that the scheduler reserves the appropriate amount of CPU and memory for each pod, guaranteeing that it has the necessary resources to operate. Resource limits cap the amount of CPU and memory a pod can use, preventing any single pod from consuming excessive resources and potentially starving other pods. When resource requests and limits are not set: Resource Starvation: Pods may get insufficient resources, leading to degraded performance or failures. This is because Kubernetes schedules pods based on these requests. Without them, the scheduler might place too many pods on a single node, leading to resource contention and performance bottlenecks. Resource Hoarding: Conversely, without limits, a pod might consume more than its fair share of resources, impacting the performance and stability of other pods on the same node. This can lead to issues such as other pods getting evicted or killed by the Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer due to lack of available memory. How to avoid it: Start with modest...	\N

This article reflects its work, accomplishments, and insights into how a working group operates.) In the complex world of Kubernetes, policies play a crucial role in managing and securing clusters. But have you ever wondered how these policies are developed, implemented, and standardized across the Kubernetes ecosystem? To answer that, let's take a look back at the work of the Policy Working Group. The Policy Working Group was dedicated to a critical mission: providing an overall architecture that encompasses both current policy-related implementations and future policy proposals in Kubernetes. Their goal was both ambitious and essential: to develop a universal policy architecture that benefits developers and end-users alike. Through collaborative methods, this working group strove to bring clarity and consistency to the often complex world of Kubernetes policies. By focusing on both existing implementations and future proposals, they ensured that the policy landscape in Kubernetes remains coherent and accessible as the technology evolves. This blog post dives deeper into the work of the Policy Working Group, guided by insights from its former co-chairs: Jim Bugwadia Poonam Lamba Andy Suderman Interviewed by Arujjwal Negi . These co-chairs explained what the Policy Working Group was all about. Introduction Hello, thank you for the time!

Karpenter is a Kubernetes Autoscaling SIG node provisioning project that helps clusters scale quickly and efficiently. It launches new nodes in seconds, selects appropriate instance types for workloads, and manages the full node lifecycle, including scale-down. The new Headlamp Karpenter Plugin adds real-time visibility into Karpenter’s activity directly from the Headlamp UI. It shows how Karpenter resources relate to Kubernetes objects, displays live metrics, and surfaces scaling events as they happen. You can inspect pending pods during provisioning, review scaling decisions, and edit Karpenter-managed resources with built-in validation. The Karpenter plugin was made as part of a LFX mentor project. The Karpenter plugin for Headlamp aims to make it easier for Kubernetes users and operators to understand, debug, and fine-tune autoscaling behavior in their clusters. Now we will give a brief tour of the Headlamp plugin. Map view of Karpenter Resources and how they relate to Kubernetes resources Easily see how Karpenter Resources like NodeClasses, NodePool and NodeClaims connect with core Kubernetes resources like Pods, Nodes etc. Visualization of Karpenter Metrics Get instant insights of Resource Usage v/s Limits, Allowed disruptions, Pending Pods, Provisioning Latency and many more .

This enhances the Kubernetes storage ecosystem by providing an efficient way for CSI storage drivers to identify changed blocks in PersistentVolume snapshots. With a driver that can use the feature, you could benefit from faster and more resource-efficient backup operations. If you're eager to try this feature, you can skip to the Getting Started section . What is changed block tracking? Changed block tracking enables storage systems to identify and track modifications at the block level between snapshots, eliminating the need to scan entire volumes during backup operations. The improvement is a change to the Container Storage Interface (CSI), and also to the storage support in Kubernetes itself. With the alpha feature enabled, your cluster can: Identify allocated blocks within a CSI volume snapshot Determine changed blocks between two snapshots of the same volume Streamline backup operations by focusing only on changed data blocks For Kubernetes users managing large datasets, this API enables significantly more efficient backup processes. Backup applications can now focus only on the blocks that have changed, rather than processing entire volumes. Note: As of now, the Changed Block Tracking API is supported only for block volumes and not for file volumes. CSI drivers that manage file-based storage systems will not be able to implement this capability. Benefits of changed block tracking support in Kubernetes As Kubernetes adoption grows for stateful workloads managing critical data, the need for efficient backup solutions becomes increasingly important. Traditional full backup approaches face challenges with: Long backup windows : Full volume backups can take hours for large datasets, making it difficult to complete within maintenance windows. High resource utilization : Backup operations consume substantial network bandwidth and I/O resources, especially for large data volumes and...	\N

This significant milestone introduces a new layer of flexibility for defining and managing resource allocation for your Pods. This flexibility stems from the ability to specify CPU and memory resources for the Pod as a whole. Pod level resources can be combined with the container-level specifications to express the exact resource requirements and limits your application needs. Pod-level specification for resources Until recently, resource specifications that applied to Pods were primarily defined at the individual container level. While effective, this approach sometimes required duplicating or meticulously calculating resource needs across multiple containers within a single Pod. As a beta feature, Kubernetes allows you to specify the CPU, memory and hugepages resources at the Pod-level. This means you can now define resource requests and limits for an entire Pod, enabling easier resource sharing without requiring granular, per-container management of these resources where it's not needed. Why does Pod-level specification matter? This feature enhances resource management in Kubernetes by offering flexible resource management at both the Pod and container levels. It provides a consolidated approach to resource declaration, reducing the need for meticulous, per-container management, especially for Pods with multiple containers. Pod-level resources enable containers within a pod to share unused resoures amongst themselves, promoting efficient utilization within the pod. For example, it prevents sidecar containers from becoming performance bottlenecks. Previously, a sidecar (e.g., a logging agent or service mesh proxy) hitting its individual CPU limit could be throttled and slow down the entire Pod, even if the main application container had plenty of spare CPU. With pod-level resources,...	\N

Meant to specify 2TB but specified 20TiB ? This seemingly innocuous problem was kinda hard to fix - and took the project almost 5 years to fix. Automated recovery from storage expansion has been around for a while in beta; however, with the v1.34 release, we have graduated this to general availability . While it was always possible to recover from failing volume expansions manually, it usually required cluster-admin access and was tedious to do (See aformentioned link for more information). What if you make a mistake and then realize immediately? With Kubernetes v1.34, you should be able to reduce the requested size of the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and, as long as the expansion to previously requested size hadn't finished, you can amend the size requested. Kubernetes will automatically work to correct it. Any quota consumed by failed expansion will be returned to the user and the associated PersistentVolume should be resized to the latest size you specified. I'll walk through an example of how all of this works. Reducing PVC size to recover from failed expansion Imagine that you are running out of disk space for one of your database servers, and you want to expand the PVC from previously specified 10TB to 100TB - but you make a typo and specify 1000TB . kind : PersistentVolumeClaim apiVersion : v1 metadata : name : myclaim spec : accessModes : - ReadWriteOnce resources : requests : storage : 1000TB # newly specified size - but incorrect! Now, you may be out of disk space on your disk array or simply ran out of allocated quota on your cloud-provider. But, assume that expansion to 1000TB is never going to succeed. In Kubernetes v1.34, you can simply correct your mistake and request a new PVC size, that is smaller than the mistake, provided it is still larger than the original size of the actual PersistentVolume. kind : PersistentVolumeClaim apiVersion : v1 metadata : name : myclaim spec...	\N

It enables flexible resource requests, going beyond simply allocating N number of devices to support more granular usage scenarios. With DRA, users can request specific types of devices based on their attributes, define custom configurations tailored to their workloads, and even share the same resource among multiple containers or Pods. In this blog, we focus on the device sharing feature and dive into a new capability introduced in Kubernetes 1.34: DRA consumable capacity , which extends DRA to support finer-grained device sharing. Background: device sharing via ResourceClaims From the beginning, DRA introduced the ability for multiple Pods to share a device by referencing the same ResourceClaim. This design decouples resource allocation from specific hardware, allowing for more dynamic and reusable provisioning of devices. In Kubernetes 1.33, the new support for partitionable devices allowed resource drivers to advertise slices of a device that are available, rather than exposing the entire device as an all-or-nothing resource. This enabled Kubernetes to model shareable hardware more accurately. But there was still a missing piece: it didn't yet support scenarios where the device driver manages fine-grained, dynamic portions of a device resource — like network bandwidth — based on user demand, or to share those resources independently of ResourceClaims, which are restricted by their spec and namespace. That’s where consumable capacity for DRA comes in. Benefits of DRA consumable capacity support Here's a taste of what you get in a cluster with the DRAConsumableCapacity feature gate enabled. Device sharing across multiple ResourceClaims or DeviceRequests Resource drivers can now support sharing the same device — or even a slice of a device — across multiple ResourceClaims or across multiple DeviceRequests. This means that Pods from different namespaces...	\N

However, as discussed in a previous blog post about navigating failures in Pods with devices , when this hardware fails, it can be difficult to diagnose, leading to significant downtime. With the release of Kubernetes v1.34, we are excited to announce a new alpha feature that brings much-needed visibility into the health of these devices. This work extends the functionality of KEP-4680 , which first introduced a mechanism for reporting the health of devices managed by Device Plugins. Now, this capability is being extended to Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) . Controlled by the ResourceHealthStatus feature gate, this enhancement allows DRA drivers to report device health directly into a Pod's .status field, providing crucial insights for operators and developers. Why expose device health in Pod status? For stateful applications or long-running jobs, a device failure can be disruptive and costly. By exposing device health in the .status field for a Pod, Kubernetes provides a standardized way for users and automation tools to quickly diagnose issues. If a Pod is failing, you can now check its status to see if an unhealthy device is the root cause, saving valuable time that might otherwise be spent debugging application code. How it works This feature introduces a new, optional communication channel between the Kubelet and DRA drivers, built on three core components. A new gRPC health service A new gRPC service, DRAResourceHealth , is defined in the dra-health/v1alpha1 API group. DRA drivers can implement this service to stream device health updates to the Kubelet. The service includes a NodeWatchResources server-streaming RPC that sends the health status ( Healthy , Unhealthy , or Unknown ) for the devices it manages.

The recent release of Kubernetes v1.34 moved that support to a second beta. The support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of extension APIs for group snapshots . These APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes. Behind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting. A key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and recover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point. This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers. What's new in Beta 2? While testing the beta version, we encountered an issue where the restoreSize field is not set for individual VolumeSnapshotContents and VolumeSnapshots if CSI driver does not implement the ListSnapshots RPC call. We evaluated various options here and decided to make this change releasing a new beta for the API. Specifically, a VolumeSnapshotInfo struct is added in v1beta2, it contains information for an individual volume snapshot that is a member of a volume group snapshot. VolumeSnapshotInfoList, a list of VolumeSnapshotInfo, is added to VolumeGroupSnapshotContentStatus, replacing VolumeSnapshotHandlePairList. VolumeSnapshotInfoList is a list of snapshot information returned by the CSI driver to identify snapshots on the storage system. VolumeSnapshotInfoList is populated by the csi-snapshotter sidecar based on the CSI CreateVolumeGroupSnapshotResponse returned by the CSI driver's CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot call. The existing v1beta1 API objects will be converted to the new v1beta2 API objects by a conversion webhook. What’s next? Depending on feedback and adoption, the Kubernetes project plans to push the volume group snapshot implementation to general availability (GA) in a future release. How can I learn more? The design spec for the volume group...	\N

Previously, the node lifecycle controller handled both marking nodes as unhealthy with NoExecute taints and evicting pods from them. Now, a dedicated taint eviction controller manages the eviction process, while the node lifecycle controller focuses solely on applying taints. This separation not only improves code organization but also makes it easier to improve taint eviction controller or build custom implementations of the taint based eviction. What's new? The feature gate SeparateTaintEvictionController has been promoted to GA in this release. Users can optionally disable taint-based eviction by setting --controllers=-taint-eviction-controller in kube-controller-manager. How can I learn more?

On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers: cgroupfs and systemd . In the past, both the kubelet and CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use the same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would misbehave without any explicit error message. This was a source of headaches for many cluster admins. Now, we've (almost) arrived at the end of that headache. Automated cgroup driver detection In v1.28.0, the SIG Node community introduced the feature gate KubeletCgroupDriverFromCRI , which instructs the kubelet to ask the CRI implementation which cgroup driver to use. You can read more here . After many releases of waiting for each CRI implementation to have major versions released and packaged in major operating systems, this feature has gone GA as of Kubernetes 1.34.0. In addition to setting the feature gate, a cluster admin needs to ensure their CRI implementation is new enough: containerd: Support was added in v2.0.0 CRI-O: Support was added in v1.28.0 Announcement: Kubernetes is deprecating containerd v1.y support While CRI-O releases versions that match Kubernetes versions, and thus CRI-O versions without this behavior are no longer supported, containerd maintains its own release cycle. containerd support for this feature is only in v2.0 and later, but Kubernetes 1.34 still supports containerd 1.7 and other LTS releases of containerd. The Kubernetes SIG Node community has formally agreed upon a final support timeline for containerd v1.y. The last Kubernetes release to offer this support will be the last released version of v1.35, and support will be dropped in v1.36.0. To assist administrators in managing this future transition, a new detection mechanism is available. You are able to monitor the kubelet_cri_losing_support metric to determine if any nodes in your cluster are using a containerd version that...	\N

This marks a significant milestone in enhancing the accuracy of stateful pod scheduling by reducing failures due to outdated attachable volume capacity information. Background Traditionally, Kubernetes CSI drivers report a static maximum volume attachment limit when initializing. However, actual attachment capacities can change during a node's lifecycle for various reasons, such as: Manual or external operations attaching/detaching volumes outside of Kubernetes control. Dynamically attached network interfaces or specialized hardware (GPUs, NICs, etc.) consuming available slots. Multi-driver scenarios, where one CSI driver’s operations affect available capacity reported by another. Static reporting can cause Kubernetes to schedule pods onto nodes that appear to have capacity but don't, leading to pods stuck in a ContainerCreating state. Dynamically adapting CSI volume limits With this new feature, Kubernetes enables CSI drivers to dynamically adjust and report node attachment capacities at runtime. This ensures that the scheduler, as well as other components relying on this information, have the most accurate, up-to-date view of node capacity. How it works Kubernetes supports two mechanisms for updating the reported node volume limits: Periodic Updates: CSI drivers specify an interval to periodically refresh the node's allocatable capacity. Reactive Updates: An immediate update triggered when a volume attachment fails due to exhausted resources ( ResourceExhausted error). Enabling the feature To use this beta feature, the MutableCSINodeAllocatableCount feature gate must be enabled in these components: kube-apiserver kubelet Example CSI driver configuration Below is an example of configuring a CSI driver to enable periodic updates every 60 seconds: apiVersion:...	\N

Alternatively, you might be using a vendor-supplied container that requires environment variables (such as a license key or a one-time token), but you don’t want to hard-code them or mount volumes just to get the job done. If that's the situation you are in, you now have a new (alpha) way to achieve that. Provided you have the EnvFiles feature gate enabled across your cluster, you can tell the kubelet to load a container's environment variables from a volume (the volume must be part of the Pod that the container belongs to). this feature gate allows you to load environment variables directly from a file in an emptyDir volume without actually mounting that file into the container. It’s a simple yet elegant solution to some surprisingly common problems. What’s this all about? At its core, this feature allows you to point your container to a file, one generated by an initContainer , and have Kubernetes parse that file to set your environment variables. The file lives in an emptyDir volume (a temporary storage space that lasts as long as the pod does), Your main container doesn’t need to mount the volume. The kubelet will read the file and inject these variables when the container starts. How It Works Here's a simple example: apiVersion : v1 kind : Pod spec : initContainers : - name : generate-config image : busybox command : [ 'sh' , '-c' , 'echo "CONFIG_VAR=HELLO" > /config/config.env' ] volumeMounts : - name : config-volume mountPath : /config containers : - name : app-container image : gcr.io/distroless/static env : - name : CONFIG_VAR valueFrom : fileKeyRef : path : config.env volumeName : config-volume key : CONFIG_VAR volumes : - name : config-volume...	\N

A major focus of this effort has been taming list requests, which have historically been a primary source of high memory usage and heavy load on the etcd datastore. With each release, we've chipped away at the problem, and today, we're thrilled to announce the final major piece of this puzzle. The snapshottable API server cache feature has graduated to Beta in Kubernetes v1.34, culminating a multi-release effort to allow virtually all read requests to be served directly from the API server's cache. Evolving the cache for performance and stability The path to the current state involved several key enhancements over recent releases that paved the way for today's announcement. Consistent reads from cache (Beta in v1.31) While the API server has long used a cache for performance, a key milestone was guaranteeing consistent reads of the latest data from it. This v1.31 enhancement allowed the watch cache to be used for strongly-consistent read requests for the first time, a huge win as it enabled filtered collections (e.g. "a list of pods bound to this node") to be safely served from the cache instead of etcd, dramatically reducing its load for common workloads. Taming large responses with streaming (Beta in v1.33) Another key improvement was tackling the problem of memory spikes when transmitting large responses. The streaming encoder, introduced in v1.33, allowed the API server to send list items one by one, rather than buffering the entire multi-gigabyte response in memory. This made the memory cost of sending a response predictable and minimal, regardless of its size. The missing piece Despite these huge improvements, a critical gap remained. Any request for a historical LIST —most commonly used for paginating through large result sets—still had to bypass the cache and query etcd directly. This meant that the cost of retrieving the data...	\N

This marks a significant milestone, providing a robust and stable way to tune your persistent storage directly within Kubernetes. What is VolumeAttributesClass? At its core, VolumeAttributesClass is a cluster-scoped resource that defines a set of mutable parameters for a volume. Think of it as a "profile" for your storage, allowing cluster administrators to expose different quality-of-service (QoS) levels or performance tiers. Users can then specify a volumeAttributesClassName in their PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to indicate which class of attributes they desire. The magic happens through the Container Storage Interface (CSI): when a PVC referencing a VolumeAttributesClass is updated, the associated CSI driver interacts with the underlying storage system to apply the specified changes to the volume. This means you can now: Dynamically scale performance: Increase IOPS or throughput for a busy database, or reduce it for a less critical application. Optimize costs: Adjust attributes on the fly to match your current needs, avoiding over-provisioning. Simplify operations: Manage volume modifications directly within the Kubernetes API, rather than relying on external tools or manual processes. What is new from Beta to GA There are two major enhancements from beta. Cancellation support when errors occur To improve resilience and user experience, the GA release introduces explicit cancel support when a requested volume modification encounters an error. If the underlying storage system or CSI driver indicates that the requested changes cannot be applied (e.g., due to invalid arguments), users can cancel the operation and revert the volume to its previous stable configuration, preventing the volume from being left in an inconsistent state. Quota support based on scope While VolumeAttributesClass doesn't add a...	\N

This blog post describes the Pod replacement policy feature and how to use it in your Jobs. About Pod Replacement Policy By default, the Job controller immediately recreates Pods as soon as they fail or begin terminating (when they have a deletion timestamp). As a result, while some Pods are terminating, the total number of running Pods for a Job can temporarily exceed the specified parallelism. For Indexed Jobs, this can even mean multiple Pods running for the same index at the same time. This behavior works fine for many workloads, but it can cause problems in certain cases. For example, popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and JAX expect exactly one Pod per worker index. If two Pods run at the same time, you might encounter errors such as: /job:worker/task:4: Duplicate task registration with task_name=/job:worker/replica:0/task:4 Additionally, starting replacement Pods before the old ones fully terminate can lead to: Scheduling delays by kube-scheduler as the nodes remain occupied. Unnecessary cluster scale-ups to accommodate the replacement Pods. Temporary bypassing of quota checks by workload orchestrators like Kueue . With Pod replacement policy, Kubernetes gives you control over when the control plane replaces terminating Pods, helping you avoid these issues. How Pod Replacement Policy works This enhancement means that Jobs in Kubernetes have an optional field .spec.podReplacementPolicy . You can choose one of two policies: TerminatingOrFailed (default): Replaces Pods as soon as they start terminating. Failed : Replaces Pods only after they fully terminate and transition to the Failed phase. Setting the policy to Failed ensures that a new Pod is only created after the previous one has completely terminated. For Jobs with a Pod Failure Policy, the default podReplacementPolicy is Failed , and no other value is allowed. See Pod Failure Policy to learn...	\N

We are excited to announce that as of Kubernetes v1.34, Pressure Stall Information (PSI) Metrics has graduated to Beta. What is Pressure Stall Information (PSI)? Pressure Stall Information (PSI) is a feature of the Linux kernel (version 4.20 and later) that provides a canonical way to quantify pressure on infrastructure resources, in terms of whether demand for a resource exceeds current supply. It moves beyond simple resource utilization metrics and instead measures the amount of time that tasks are stalled due to resource contention. This is a powerful way to identify and diagnose resource bottlenecks that can impact application performance. PSI exposes metrics for CPU, memory, and I/O, categorized as either some or full pressure: some The percentage of time that at least one task is stalled on a resource. This indicates some level of resource contention. full The percentage of time that all non-idle tasks are stalled on a resource simultaneously. This indicates a more severe resource bottleneck. PSI: 'Some' vs. 'Full' Pressure These metrics are aggregated over 10-second, 1-minute, and 5-minute rolling windows, providing a comprehensive view of resource pressure over time. PSI metrics in Kubernetes With the KubeletPSI feature gate enabled, the kubelet can now collect PSI metrics from the Linux kernel and expose them through two channels: the Summary API and the /metrics/cadvisor Prometheus endpoint. This allows you to monitor and alert on resource pressure at the node, pod, and container level. The following new metrics are available in Prometheus exposition format via /metrics/cadvisor : container_pressure_cpu_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_cpu_waiting_seconds_total container_pressure_memory_stalled_seconds_total container_pressure_memory_waiting_seconds_total container_pressure_io_stalled_seconds_total...	\N

This CPU Manager Policy Option is designed to optimize performance for specific workloads running on processors with a split uncore cache architecture. In this article, I'll explain what that means and why it's useful. Understanding the feature What is uncore cache? Until relatively recently, nearly all mainstream computer processors had a monolithic last-level-cache cache that was shared across every core in a multiple CPU package. This monolithic cache is also referred to as uncore cache (because it is not linked to a specific core), or as Level 3 cache. As well as the Level 3 cache, there is other cache, commonly called Level 1 and Level 2 cache, that is associated with a specific CPU core. In order to reduce access latency between the CPU cores and their cache, recent AMD64 and ARM architecture based processors have introduced a split uncore cache architecture, where the last-level-cache is divided into multiple physical caches, that are aligned to specific CPU groupings within the physical package. The shorter distances within the CPU package help to reduce latency. Kubernetes is able to place workloads in a way that accounts for the cache topology within the CPU package(s). Cache-aware workload placement The matrix below shows the CPU-to-CPU latency measured in nanoseconds (lower is better) when passing a packet between CPUs, via its cache coherence protocol on a processor that uses split uncore cache. In this example, the processor package consists of 2 uncore caches. Each uncore cache serves 8 CPU cores. Blue entries in the matrix represent latency between CPUs sharing the same uncore cache, while grey entries indicate latency between CPUs corresponding to different uncore caches. Latency between CPUs that correspond to different caches are higher than the latency between CPUs...	\N

This release marks a major milestone with many APIs in the resource.k8s.io group graduating to General Availability (GA), unlocking the full potential of how you manage devices on Kubernetes. On top of that, several key features have moved to beta, and a fresh batch of new alpha features promise even more expressiveness and flexibility. Let's dive into what's new for DRA in Kubernetes 1.34! The core of DRA is now GA The headline feature of the v1.34 release is that the core of DRA has graduated to General Availability. Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) provides a flexible framework for managing specialized hardware and infrastructure resources, such as GPUs or FPGAs. DRA provides APIs that enable each workload to specify the properties of the devices it needs, but leaving it to the scheduler to allocate actual devices, allowing increased reliability and improved utilization of expensive hardware. With the graduation to GA, DRA is stable and will be part of Kubernetes for the long run. The community can still expect a steady stream of new features being added to DRA over the next several Kubernetes releases, but they will not make any breaking changes to DRA. So users and developers of DRA drivers can start adopting DRA with confidence. Starting with Kubernetes 1.34, DRA is enabled by default; the DRA features that have reached beta are also enabled by default. That's because the default API version for DRA is now the stable v1 version, and not the earlier versions (eg: v1beta1 or v1beta2 ) that needed explicit opt in. Features promoted to beta Several powerful features have been promoted to beta, adding more control, flexibility, and observability to resource management with DRA. Admin access labelling has been updated. In v1.34, you can restrict device support to people (or software) authorized to use it. This is meant as a way to avoid...	\N

This feature, named Container Restart Policy and Rules , allows you to specify a restart policy for each container individually, overriding the Pod's global restart policy. In addition, it also allows you to conditionally restart individual containers based on their exit codes. This feature is available behind the alpha feature gate ContainerRestartRules . This has been a long-requested feature. Let's dive into how it works and how you can use it. The problem with a single restart policy Before this feature, the restartPolicy was set at the Pod level. This meant that all containers in a Pod shared the same restart policy ( Always , OnFailure , or Never ). While this works for many use cases, it can be limiting in others. For example, consider a Pod with a main application container and an init container that performs some initial setup. You might want the main container to always restart on failure, but the init container should only run once and never restart. With a single Pod-level restart policy, this wasn't possible. Introducing per-container restart policies With the new ContainerRestartRules feature gate, you can now specify a restartPolicy for each container in your Pod's spec. You can also define restartPolicyRules to control restarts based on exit codes. This gives you the fine-grained control you need to handle complex scenarios. Use cases Let's look at some real-life use cases where per-container restart policies can be beneficial. In-place restarts for training jobs In ML research, it's common to orchestrate a large number of long-running AI/ML training workloads. In these scenarios, workload failures are unavoidable. When a workload fails with a retriable exit code, you want the container to restart quickly without rescheduling the entire Pod, which consumes a significant amount of time and resources....	\N

Or maybe, you'd like to have custom aliases defined, but not necessarily generate hundreds of them manually ? Look no further. SIG-CLI has been working hard to add user preferences to kubectl , and we are happy to announce that this functionality is reaching beta as part of the Kubernetes v1.34 release. How it works A full description of this functionality is available in our official documentation , but this blog post will answer both of the questions from the beginning of this article. Before we dive into details, let's quickly cover what the user preferences file looks like and where to place it. By default, kubectl will look for kuberc file in your default kubeconfig directory, which is $HOME/.kube . Alternatively, you can specify this location using --kuberc option or the KUBERC environment variable. Just like every Kubernetes manifest, kuberc file will start with an apiVersion and kind : apiVersion : kubectl.config.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind : Preference # the user preferences will follow here Defaults Let's start by setting default values for kubectl command options. Our goal is to always use interactive delete, which means we want the --interactive option for kubectl delete to always be set to true . This can be achieved with the following addition to our kuberc file: defaults : - command : delete options : - name : interactive default : "true" In the above example, I'm introducing defaults section, which allows users to define default values for kubectl options. In this case, we're setting the interactive option for kubectl delete to be true by default. This default can be overridden if a user explicitly provides a different value such as kubectl delete --interactive=false , in which case the explicit option takes precedence. Another highly encouraged default from SIG-CLI, is using Server-Side Apply . To do so, you can add the following snippet to your preferences: # continuing...	\N

The consistent delivery of high-quality releases underscores the strength of our development cycle and the vibrant support from our community. This release consists of 58 enhancements. Of those enhancements, 23 have graduated to Stable, 22 have entered Beta, and 13 have entered Alpha. There are also some deprecations and removals in this release; make sure to read about those. Release theme and logo A release powered by the wind around us — and the will within us. Every release cycle, we inherit winds that we don't really control — the state of our tooling, documentation, and the historical quirks of our project. Sometimes these winds fill our sails, sometimes they push us sideways or die down. What keeps Kubernetes moving isn't the perfect winds, but the will of our sailors who adjust the sails, man the helm, chart the courses and keep the ship steady. The release happens not because conditions are always ideal, but because of the people who build it, the people who release it, and the bears ^ , cats, dogs, wizards, and curious minds who keep Kubernetes sailing strong — no matter which way the wind blows. This release, Of Wind & Will (O' WaW) , honors the winds that have shaped us, and the will that propels us forward. ^ Oh, and you wonder why bears? Keep wondering!

This article focuses exclusively on tuning swap on Linux nodes, where this feature is available. By allowing Linux nodes to use secondary storage for additional virtual memory when physical RAM is exhausted, node swap support aims to improve resource utilization and reduce out-of-memory (OOM) kills. However, enabling swap is not a "turn-key" solution. The performance and stability of your nodes under memory pressure are critically dependent on a set of Linux kernel parameters. Misconfiguration can lead to performance degradation and interfere with Kubelet's eviction logic. In this blogpost, I'll dive into critical Linux kernel parameters that govern swap behavior. I will explore how these parameters influence Kubernetes workload performance, swap utilization, and crucial eviction mechanisms. I will present various test results showcasing the impact of different configurations, and share my findings on achieving optimal settings for stable and high-performing Kubernetes clusters. Introduction to Linux swap At a high level, the Linux kernel manages memory through pages, typically 4KiB in size. When physical memory becomes constrained, the kernel's page replacement algorithm decides which pages to move to swap space. While the exact logic is a sophisticated optimization, this decision-making process is influenced by certain key factors: Page access patterns (how recently pages are accessed) Page dirtyness (whether pages have been modified) Memory pressure (how urgently the system needs free memory) Anonymous vs File-backed memory It is important to understand that not all memory pages are the same. The kernel distinguishes between anonymous and file-backed memory. Anonymous memory : This is memory that is not backed by a specific file on the disk,...	\N

This release will not include any removal or deprecation, but it is packed with an impressive number of enhancements. Here are some of the features we are most excited about in this cycle! Please note that this information reflects the current state of v1.34 development and may change before release. Featured enhancements of Kubernetes v1.34 The following list highlights some of the notable enhancements likely to be included in the v1.34 release, but is not an exhaustive list of all planned changes. This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change. The core of DRA targets stable Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) provides a flexible way to categorize, request, and use devices like GPUs or custom hardware in your Kubernetes cluster. Since the v1.30 release, DRA has been based around claiming devices using structured parameters that are opaque to the core of Kubernetes. The relevant enhancement proposal, KEP-4381 , took inspiration from dynamic provisioning for storage volumes. DRA with structured parameters relies on a set of supporting API kinds: ResourceClaim, DeviceClass, ResourceClaimTemplate, and ResourceSlice API types under resource.k8s.io , while extending the .spec for Pods with a new resourceClaims field. The core of DRA is targeting graduation to stable in Kubernetes v1.34. With DRA, device drivers and cluster admins define device classes that are available for use. Workloads can claim devices from a device class within device requests. Kubernetes allocates matching devices to specific claims and places the corresponding Pods on nodes that can access the allocated devices. This framework provides flexible device filtering using CEL, centralized device categorization, and simplified Pod requests, among other benefits. Once this feature has graduated, the resource.k8s.io/v1 APIs will be available by default. ServiceAccount tokens for image pull authentication The ServiceAccount token...	\N

This blog post dives into the challenges of managing failure modes when operating pods with devices in Kubernetes, based on insights from Sergey Kanzhelev and Mrunal Patel's talk at KubeCon NA 2024 . You can follow the links to slides and recording . The AI/ML boom and its impact on Kubernetes The rise of AI/ML workloads has brought new challenges to Kubernetes. These workloads often rely heavily on specialized hardware, and any device failure can significantly impact performance and lead to frustrating interruptions. As highlighted in the 2024 Llama paper , hardware issues, particularly GPU failures, are a major cause of disruption in AI/ML training. You can also learn how much effort NVIDIA spends on handling devices failures and maintenance in the KubeCon talk by Ryan Hallisey and Piotr Prokop All-Your-GPUs-Are-Belong-to-Us: An Inside Look at NVIDIA's Self-Healing GeForce NOW Infrastructure ( recording ) as they see 19 remediation requests per 1000 nodes a day! We also see data centers offering spot consumption models and overcommit on power, making device failures commonplace and a part of the business model. However, Kubernetes’s view on resources is still very static. The resource is either there or not. And if it is there, the assumption is that it will stay there fully functional - Kubernetes lacks good support for handling full or partial hardware failures. These long-existing assumptions combined with the overall complexity of a setup lead to a variety of failure modes, which we discuss here. Understanding AI/ML workloads Generally, all AI/ML workloads require specialized hardware, have challenging scheduling requirements, and are expensive when idle. AI/ML workloads typically fall into two categories - training and inference. Here is an oversimplified view of those categories’...	\N

It is common practice to require the use of specific versions of the kernel, its configuration, device drivers, or system components. Despite the existence of the Open Container Initiative (OCI) , a governing community to define standards and specifications for container images, there has been a gap in expression of such compatibility requirements. The need to address this issue has led to different proposals and, ultimately, an implementation in Kubernetes' Node Feature Discovery (NFD) . NFD is an open source Kubernetes project that automatically detects and reports hardware and system features of cluster nodes. This information helps users to schedule workloads on nodes that meet specific system requirements, which is especially useful for applications with strict hardware or operating system dependencies. The need for image compatibility specification Dependencies between containers and host OS A container image is built on a base image, which provides a minimal runtime environment, often a stripped-down Linux userland, completely empty or distroless. When an application requires certain features from the host OS, compatibility issues arise. These dependencies can manifest in several ways: Drivers : Host driver versions must match the supported range of a library version inside the container to avoid compatibility problems. Examples include GPUs and network drivers. Libraries or Software : The container must come with a specific version or range of versions for a library or software to run optimally in the environment.

Stand by for more details, but for now, there is no urgency to back up private channels or direct messages. Kubernetes Slack will lose its special status and will be changing into a standard free Slack on June 20, 2025 . Sometime later this year, our community may move to a new platform. If you are responsible for a channel or private channel, or a member of a User Group, you will need to take some actions as soon as you can. For the last decade, Slack has supported our project with a free customized enterprise account. They have let us know that they can no longer do so, particularly since our Slack is one of the largest and more active ones on the platform. As such, they will be downgrading it to a standard free Slack while we decide on, and implement, other options. On Friday, June 20, we will be subject to the feature limitations of free Slack . The primary ones which will affect us will be only retaining 90 days of history, and having to disable several apps and workflows which we are currently using. The Slack Admin team will do their best to manage these limitations. Responsible channel owners, members of private channels, and members of User Groups should take some actions to prepare for the upgrade and preserve information as soon as possible. The CNCF Projects Staff have proposed that our community look at migrating to Discord. Because of existing issues where we have been pushing the limits of Slack, they have already explored what a Kubernetes Discord would look like. Discord would allow us to implement new tools and integrations which would help the community, such as GitHub group membership synchronization. The Steering Committee will discuss and decide on our future platform. Please see our FAQ , and check the kubernetes-dev mailing list and the #announcements channel for further news. If you have specific feedback on our Slack status join the...	\N

This blog post explores how to build custom event aggregation systems that help engineering teams better understand cluster behavior and troubleshoot issues more effectively. The challenge with Kubernetes events In a Kubernetes cluster, events are generated for various operations - from pod scheduling and container starts to volume mounts and network configurations. While these events are invaluable for debugging and monitoring, several challenges emerge in production environments: Volume : Large clusters can generate thousands of events per minute Retention : Default event retention is limited to one hour Correlation : Related events from different components are not automatically linked Classification : Events lack standardized severity or category classifications Aggregation : Similar events are not automatically grouped To learn more about Events in Kubernetes, read the Event API reference. Real-World value Consider a production environment with tens of microservices where the users report intermittent transaction failures: Traditional event aggregation process: Engineers are wasting hours sifting through thousands of standalone events spread across namespaces. By the time they look into it, the older events have long since purged, and correlating pod restarts to node-level issues is practically impossible. With its event aggregation in its custom events: The system groups events across resources, instantly surfacing correlation patterns such as volume mount timeouts before pod restarts. History indicates it occurred during past record traffic spikes, highlighting a storage scalability issue in minutes rather than hours. The beneﬁt of this approach is that organizations that implement it commonly cut down their troubleshooting time significantly along with increasing the reliability of systems by...	\N

The accumulating context from the codebase was eating through tokens fast. So I built a language designed to be generated by AI rather than written by humans. GlyphLang GlyphLang replaces verbose keywords with symbols that tokenize more efficiently: # Python @app.route('/users/') def get_user(id): user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", id) return jsonify(user) # GlyphLang @ GET /users/:id { $ user = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", id) > user } @ = route, $ = variable, > = return. Initial benchmarks show ~45% fewer tokens than Python, ~63% fewer than Java. In practice, that means more logic fits in context, and sessions stretch longer before hitting limits. The AI maintains a broader view of your codebase throughout. Before anyone asks: no, this isn't APL with extra steps. APL, Perl, and Forth are symbol-heavy but optimized for mathematical notation, human terseness, or machine efficiency. GlyphLang is specifically optimized for how modern LLMs tokenize. It's designed to be generated by AI and reviewed by humans, not the other way around. That said, it's still readable enough to be written or tweaked if the occasion requires. It's still a work in progress, but it's a usable language with a bytecode compiler, JIT, LSP, VS Code extension, PostgreSQL, WebSockets, async/await, generics.

It's currently pre-alpha, AGPL-licensed, and available to try now[0]. My wife and I have a personal library with around 1,800 books. I started working on a library management tool for us, but I quickly realized I needed a source of data for book information, and none of the solutions available provided all the data I needed. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and another might provide a good cover, but none provided everything. So I started working on Librario, a book metadata aggregation API written in Go. It fetches information about books from multiple sources (Google Books, ISBNDB, Hardcover. Working on Goodreads and Anna's Archive next.), merges everything, and saves it all to a PostgreSQL database for future lookups. The idea is that the database gets stronger over time as more books are queried. You can see an example response here[1], or try it yourself: curl -s -H 'Authorization: Bearer librario_ARbmrp1fjBpDywzhvrQcByA4sZ9pn7D5HEk0kmS34eqRcaujyt0enCZ' \\ 'https://api.librario.dev/v1/book/9781328879943' | jq . This is pre-alpha and runs on a small VPS, so keep that in mind. I never hit the limits in the third-party services, so depending on how this post goes, I’ll or will not find out if the code handles that well. The merger is the heart of the service, and figuring out how to combine conflicting data from different sources was the hardest part. In the end I decided to use field-specific strategies which are quite naive, but work for now. Each extractor has a priority, and results are sorted by that priority before merging. But priority alone isn't enough, so different fields need different treatment. For example: - Titles use a scoring system. I penalize titles containing parentheses or brackets because sources sometimes shove...	\N

I built a system for Claude Code to browse 100 non-fiction books and find interesting connections between them. I started out with a pipeline in stages, chaining together LLM calls to build up a context of the library. I was mainly getting back the insight that I was baking into the prompts, and the results weren't particularly surprising. On a whim, I gave CC access to my debug CLI tools and found that it wiped the floor with that approach. It gave actually interesting results and required very little orchestration in comparison. One of my favourite trail of excerpts goes from Jobs’ reality distortion field to Theranos’ fake demos, to Thiel on startup cults, to Hoffer on mass movement charlatans ( https://trails.pieterma.es/trail/useful-lies/ ). A fun tendency is that Claude kept getting distracted by topics of secrecy, conspiracy, and hidden systems - as if the task itself summoned a Foucault’s Pendulum mindset. Details: * The books are picked from HN’s favourites (which I collected before: https://hnbooks.pieterma.es/ ). * Chunks are indexed by topic using Gemini Flash Lite. The whole library cost about £10. * Topics are organised into a tree structure using recursive Leiden partitioning and LLM labels. This gives a high-level sense of the themes. * There are several ways to browse. The most useful are embedding similarity, topic tree siblings, and topics cooccurring within a chunk window. * Everything is stored in SQLite and manipulated using a set of CLI tools. I wrote more about the process here: https://pieterma.es/syntopic-reading-claude/ I’m curious if this way of reading resonates for anyone else - LLM-mediated or not.

Continuing the unfortunate chain of disrupted releases, this release failed due to an error publishing new PEP 740 attestations to PyPI. The release workflow was re-run after removing the PEP 740 attestations (see #16944 ) and our GitHub and PyPI artifacts were published as normal, but the crates.io publish completed in the first run and does not match the 0.9.15 tag — instead, the crates were published at commit e7af583 .

We wanted to share our recent web app made in Go with y'all, an NGINX Log visualizer (here are links to the [code ](https://github.com/codercatclub/nginx-viz)and [demo video](https://codercat.xyz/nginx-visualizer/)).\n\nWe made the app in the style of Defend your Castle. When connected to an NGINX log, the app displays incoming requests as they approach the corresponding server.\n\nThis app development started when we noticed a stream of requests from Open AI bots crawling our website. We felt the need to fight back, and generally understand the invisible landscape of the internet around us.\n\nWe have a ThreeJS frontend because we love 3D and utilizing the spatial dimension. Requests from the same IP appear from the same spatial location, IPs are parsed to country flags, device names are simplified, and avatar type signals the intent of the request. For example, most ethical crawlers and bots will let their identity be known in the sender URL. Possible malicious agents can be identified when you see requests going to urls such as .env, .git, or /admin.\n\nThis app is compiled to a single binary for ease of use. If you would like to try it out on your own NGINX server log, you can download the latest release on [Github](https://github.com/codercatclub/nginx-viz/releases/tag/v1.0.0). Any feedback is welcome:)   \n\n\nFuture developments include the ability to adjust your NGINX config directly through the web app, providing a real-time defence strategy:)	\N

Thought it might be useful for some of you as well. It implements two approaches to testing: ephemeral transactions and ephemeral databases. The ephemeral transaction pattern is when you create a transaction, do business logic on top of it, assert, and roll back—that way no data is committed to the database. The ephemeral database approach actually creates a new isolated database for each test case.\n\nI shared more insights in the blog post [https://segfaultmedaddy.com/p/pgxephemeraltest/](https://segfaultmedaddy.com/p/pgxephemeraltest/) on the implementation details and driving mechanisms behind the patterns.\n\nHere's the package repo: [https://github.com/segfaultmedaddy/pgxephemeraltest](https://github.com/segfaultmedaddy/pgxephemeraltest)\n\nAnd to get started with the module, use [go.segfaultmedaddy.com/pgxephemeraltest](http://go.segfaultmedaddy.com/pgxephemeraltest)\n\nIf you like it, consider dropping a star on GitHub or tweeting about the thing; I would appreciate it, mates.	\N

It extends stdlib errors with classification tags, user-safe messages, and structured attributes — but I want to make sure the approach doesn't fight Go's philosophy.\n\nSmall, idiomatic example\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    "errors"\n    "fmt"\n\n    "github.com/go-extras/errx"\n)\n\nvar ErrNotFound = errx.NewSentinel("not found")\n\nfunc repo(userID int) error {\n    // Data layer: classification + attrs, no user message.\n    base := errors.New("sql: no rows in result set")\n    return errx.Wrap("select user", base,\n        ErrNotFound,\n        errx.WithAttrs("user_id", userID),\n    )\n}\n\nfunc getUser(userID int) error {\n\t// Service layer: attach user-safe message (optional; could also be done in transport layer).\n    if err := repo(userID); err != nil {\n        return errx.Wrap("get user", err, errx.NewDisplayable("user not found"))\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    err := getUser(123)\n    fmt.Println(errors.Is(err, ErrNotFound))               // true\n    fmt.Println(errx.DisplayTextDefault(err, "not found")) // "user not found"\n    fmt.Println(err)                                       // "get user: select user: sql: no rows in result set"\n}\n```\n\nThe problem\n- Classifying errors at boundaries (HTTP codes, retry, metrics) without string matching.\n- Separating internal messages (logs) from user-safe messages (API responses).\n\nThe approach\n- Sentinels for classification (work with errors.Is; can have parent categories).\n- Optional displayable messages — intended to be set at boundaries, not deep in the stack.\n- Attributes travel with the error for structured logging.\n- Builds on stdlib, zero deps, no panics.\n\nBoundary example\n\n```go\nerr := getUser(123)\nswitch {\ncase errors.Is(err, ErrNotFound):\n    http.Error(w, errx.DisplayTextDefault(err, "not found"), http.StatusNotFound)\ndefault:\n    http.Error(w, "internal error",...	\N

So far I have applied it to two different projects: Interfacing a serial coin acceptor to an N64 and 2-axis satellite tracker. Here are some of the biggest wins I've discovered:\n\n1. Easy Cross Compilation\n\nIt's trivial to develop on your main machine, run `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o sat_tracker` and then `scp` it over the Pi\n\n2. Using Viper/Config files for GPIO\n\nFor the satellite tracker, I could easily change the GPIO pins I was using for the stepper drivers without recompiling. This came in really handy when I made the jump from a breadboard to a more permanent solution.\n\n3. Using interfaces for abstracting hardware\n\nHere is an example of an Interface for an N64 flashcart\n\n        type N64 interface {\n        \tStart() error\n        \tClose() error\n        \tSendData(data []byte) error\n        \tReceiveData() ([]byte, error)\n        }\n\nIn the future, if I ever move to a different flashcart, the primary logic of the code stays the same.\n\n4. Mocking Hardware\n\nThis is also really useful for mocking things like GPIO pins on desktop PCs that don't have that hardware. I could run tests with the SGP4 orbital math and test that the steppers would have gone to the correct angle based on the number of calls to `High()` and `Low()`\n\nAll in all, this has been a really useful exercise and I hope to build some neat packages to use across even more projects in the future.\n\nIf you'd like to see these projects in action, I made some YouTube videos to showcase them:\n\n* [Satellite Tracker](https://youtu.be/NZe8RbimB9g)\n* [N64 coin acceptor mod](https://youtu.be/Z_uFcPic5kE)	\N

How's the stability?	u/Equivalent-Figure-12	2026-01-09 14:58:05	2026-01-11 01:42:14.756936	Hey all,\n\nI’ve been building a desktop app with Wails, and it’s actually grown to the point where I now have some real users. I love the Go + frontend workflow, but I’m seriously hitting a wall with v2. The lack of native multi-window support and a proper tray API has become a massive headache.I’ve had to rely on some community solutions, but getting them such as system tray to play nicely with Wails v2’s lifecycle is a difficulty.\n\nI’ve been eyeing Wails v3 for a while because it seems to fix exactly what I’m struggling with. But it’s been in alpha for so long, and since I now have actual users depending on my app, I’m terrified of introducing new instability and I dont want to use electron or tarui though they are also excellent frameworks.\n\nFor anyone who’s already taken the plunge and switched to v3, is it “production-stable” in practice, or are you still running into frequent crashes? Specifically, do the multi-window and system tray features work reliably across windows and macos, or are there still a bunch of weird workarounds needed?\n\nI’m dying to move over for the new features, but I’d love to hear some real-world feedback before I commit.

I have just barely looked into Go before. Go took my interest because if felt like the perfect blend of ease of Python and memory efficiency and performance of C. I think I am kind of correct. I built this for a my side project. I normally don't do vibe coding, and only use LLMs for certain kind of tasks like creating a cURL using logs. But in this project more than 80% of code is AI generated. \n\nThe purpose of this project is easy mock API generation. I am planning to release our side project soon  which supposed to use this as the core API engine. What complete project does is turning rest api docs into working mock APIs for testing in few seconds using LLMs. (This is not marketing, i haven't mentioned the name here.)\n\nThis project includes features such as \n- Custom json configuration template based declarative API generation\n- Intermediate Representation mechanism for  handling different template versions (useful for backward compatibility)\n- Zero downtime hot reloading for dynamic endpoints using a file watcher.\n- HTTP request chaining. (This can be used as upstream proxy or API manager or integration layer)\n- Dynamic WASM compilation for user code. (User code compiles on the run without blocking or restarting)\n- Distributed WASM caching using S3 compatible storage for fast startup.(User code only compile when it is added or changed, unless it is stored in a S3 cache and retrieved on startup. I guess this is useful for auto scaling, unless it will take hours to compile all the user code on startup)\n- Declaration based rate limiting/resource limitation for each and every API/User code.\n- Network timeout/Jitter simulation for realistic API simulation.\n- Request validation and authentication simulation.\n- Open telemetry integration for APM and observability.\n\nThis project currently works good enough for my current use case. And there is still a lot to improve. Since I am still novice in Go this is too...	\N

The release note explicitly cites the usage for an optional field in a struct, in the form of `*int`.\n\nNow I'm wondering whether it would be the case to leverage `new(expr)` as a form of optional argument for functions.\n\nFor example:\n\n    func foo(s *string) {\n        if s != nil {\n            println(s)\n        } else {\n            println("NO VALUE")\n        }\n    }\n    \n    func main() {\n        foo(new("some value")) // present\n        foo(nil)               // absent\n    }\n\nIt looks **so clean**.\n\nSo I'm asking you people with experience in Go: are we witnessing the birth of a new idiom to deal with optional parameters?	\N

You MUST fully read &amp; close the response body\n\n    resp, _ := client.Do(req)\n    defer resp.Body.Close()\n    io.Copy(io.Discard, resp.Body) // drain body\n    \n\nIf you only call `Close()` without draining — the connection is discarded, not reused.\n\n# 2. Never create a new http.Client per request\n\nThis silently disables pooling.\n\n    // BAD\n    client := &amp;http.Client{}\n    client.Do(req)\n    \n\nCreate **one client and reuse it everywhere**.\n\n# 3. Tune your Transport\n\n    transport := &amp;http.Transport{\n        MaxIdleConns:        100,\n        MaxIdleConnsPerHost: 10,\n        IdleConnTimeout:     90 * time.Second,\n    }\n    client := &amp;http.Client{Transport: transport}\n    \n\nDefaults are conservative and can throttle throughput under load.\n\n# 4. HTTP/2 makes this even more powerful\n\nWith HTTP/2, a **single TCP connection can serve many concurrent requests** — but only if reuse isn’t broken.\n\n\n\n**Interesting read**: [https://davidbacisin.com/writing/golang-http-connection-pools-1](https://davidbacisin.com/writing/golang-http-connection-pools-1)	\N

I and my cofounders decided to open https://grantflow.ai as source-available (BSL) and make the repo public. Why? well, we didn't manage to get sufficient traction in our former strategy, so we decided to pivot. Additionally, I had some of my mentees helping with the development (junior devs), and its good for their GitHub profiles to have this available. \n\nYou can see the codebase here: https://github.com/grantflow-ai/grantflow -- I worked on this extensively for the better part of a year. This features a complex and high performance RAG system with the following components:\n\n1. An `indexer` service, which uses [kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg) for text extraction.\n2. A `crawler` service, which does the same but for URLs.\n3. A `rag` service, which uses pgvector and a bunch of ML to perform sophisticated RAG.\n4. A `backend` service, which is the backend for the frontend.\n5. Several frontend app components, including a NextJS app and an editor based on TipTap. \n\nI am proud of this codebase - I wrote most of it, and while we did use AI agents, it started out by being hand-written and its still mostly human written. It show cases various things that can bring value to you guys:\n\n1. how to integrate SQLAlchemy with pgvector for effective RAG\n2. how to create evaluation layers and feedback loops\n3. usage of various Python libraries with correct async patterns (also ML in async context)\n4. usage of the Litestar framework in production\n5. how to create an effective uv + pnpm monorepo\n6. advanced GitHub workflows and integration with terraform\n\nI'm glad to answer questions. \n\nP.S. if you wanna chat with me on discord, I am on the [Kreuzberg discord server](https://discord.gg/D5ZR83W5KM)	\N

PIL Image and OpenCV\n3. output as tensors or TFRecords\n4. tensor backends: NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow\n5. float and integer dtypes\n\nThe goal is simple:\nwrite your data creation code once, keep it framework-agnostic, and stop rewriting glue.\nIt’s open source, optimized, and designed to be boring .\n\nEdit:\nResizing and Augmentation is also supported, these are opt in features.\nThey follow Deterministic parallelism and D4 symmetry lossless Augmentation \nPlease refer to documentation for more details \n\n\nIf you want to try it:\npip install img2tensor\n\nDocumentation : https://pypi.org/project/img2tensor/\n\nGitHub source code: https://github.com/sourabhyadav999/img2tensor\n\nFeedback and suggestions are very welcome.	\N

Also, the docs here might be the most complete guide to Product Hunt API quirks and data access limitations you'll find 😄  \n  \nWhat are your thoughts on having both synchronous and asynchronous implementations? How do you do it in your own libraries?	\N

It acts as an intelligent proxy that:  \n1. Rotates Keys: Automatically cycles through your provided API keys to maximize rate limits.  \n2. Auto-Fallbacks: If one provider (e.g., Groq) is exhausted or down, it seamlessly switches to the next available one (e.g., Gemini).  \n3. Unifies Syntax: You use one simple client.chat() method, and it handles the specific formatting for each provider behind the scenes.  \n4. Supports Streaming: Full support for token streaming for chat applications.  \n  \n  \nTarget Audience  \nThis tool is meant for developers, students, and researchers who are building MVPs, prototypes, or hobby projects.  \n\\- Production? It is not recommended for mission-critical production workloads (yet), as it relies on free tiers which can be unpredictable.  \n\\- Perfect for: Hackathons, testing different models (GPT-4o vs Llama 3), and running personal AI assistants without a credit card.  \n  \n  \nComparison  \nThere are other libraries like LiteLLM or LangChain that unify API syntax, but FreeFlow differs in its focus on "Free Tier Optimization".  \n\\- vs LiteLLM/LangChain: Those libraries are great for connecting to any provider, but you still hit rate limits on a single key immediately. FreeFlow is specifically architected to handle multiple keys and multiple providers as a single pool of resources to maximize uptime for free users.  \n\\- vs Manual Implementation: Writing your own try/except loops to switch from Groq to Gemini is tedious and messy. FreeFlow handles the context management, session closing, and error handling for you.  \n  \n  \nExample Usage:  \n  \n`pip install freeflow-llm`\n\n    #...	\N

However unlike actual Petri nets with their formal semantics it is really easy to read, understand, and write, by being very intuitive. You can directly infer control flow without knowing mathematical concepts, because Pytrithons semantics is very simple and intuitive. Traditional textual programming languages operate through a tree structure of files, each of which are linear lines of statements. Pytrithon's core language is a two dimensional interconnected graph of Elements instead, yet can interact with traditional textual Python modules where needed. To grasp traditional control flow, you have to inspect all files of the tree of code and infer how all the snippets are interconnected, jumping from file to file, desperately reverse engineering the recursive mess of functions calling other functions.\n\nPytrithon goes all in on Agent orientation, Agents are the basis to structure the programs you will create. Although surely some use cases can be solved through one single Agent, Pytrithon's strength is multiple Agents cooperating with one another in a choreography to synthesize an application. Inter-agent communication is a native part of Pytrithon and a core feature, abstracted even across system boundaries, where a local Agent interacts the same way as a remote Agent.\n\nThe Pytrithon formalism consists of Elements which are Places, Transitions, Gadgets, Fragments, and Meta Elements, each with their own specialized purpose, all interconnected through five types of Arcs. Places are passive containers for Python objects, and come in many variants, tailored to different data usecases, like simple variables, flow triggers, queues, stacks, and more. Transitions are active actors, which perform actions; the simplest, most common, and most powerful of which are Python Transitions, which are the actual code of the Agent and are simply embedded into a...	\N

We'll need something that plays well with both sync and async code and is relatively accessible even for those without a computer science background (lots of us are geneticists and bioinformaticists).	\N

The flow is: a user calls /cluster/register, the backend generates a cluster\\_id and a secret, creates a Keycloak client (client\\_id = conn-&lt;cluster\\_id&gt;), and injects these into the connector manifest. The connector authenticates to Keycloak using OAuth2 client-credentials, receives a JWT, and uses it to authenticate to backend endpoints like /heartbeat and /callback, which the backend verifies via Keycloak JWKS. This works, but I’m questioning whether Keycloak is actually necessary if /cluster/register is protected (e.g., only trusted users can onboard clusters), since the backend is effectively minting and binding machine identities anyway. Keycloak provides centralized revocation and rotation, but I’m unsure whether it adds meaningful security value here versus a simpler backend-issued secret or mTLS/SPIFFE model.

It takes \\~2–3 minutes to become ready again. During that window, another service triggers a request to Service X to fetch data, which causes a brief but visible outage.\n\nCurrent options we’re considering:\n\n1.

I’ve inherited a bit of a mess, and I’m trying to move us toward a more stable, production-ready architecture.\n\n# The Current State\n\n**Cluster 1: The "Old Reliable" (3 Nodes)**\n\n* **Age:** 3 years old, generally stable.\n* **Storage:** Running Portworx (free/trial), but since they changed their licensing, we need to migrate ASAP.\n* **Key Services:** Holds our company SSO (Keycloak), a Habour Registry and utility services.\n* **Networking:** A mix of HTTP/HTTPS termination.\n\n**Cluster 2: The "Wild West" (Newer, High Workload)**\n\n* **The Issue:** This cluster is "dirty." Several worker nodes are also running legacy Docker Compose services outside of K8s.\n* **The Single Point of Failure:** One single worker node is acting as the NFS storage provisioner **and** the Docker registry for the whole cluster. If this node blinks, the whole cluster dies. I fought against this, but didn't have the "privilege" to stop it at the time.\n* **Networking:** Ingress runs purely on HTTP, with SSL terminated at an external edge proxy.\n\n**The "Red Tape" Factor:** Both clusters sit behind an Nginx edge proxy managed by a separate IT Network team. Any change requires a ticket—the DevOps/Dev teams have no direct control over entry. I can work with the IT Network team to change this if needed. Also TLS certificate renewing is still manual, I want to change this.\n\n# The Plan &amp; Where I Need Help\n\nI need to clean this up before something catastrophic happens. Here is what I’m thinking, but I’d love your input:\n\n1. **Storage Migration:** Since Portworx is no longer an option for us, what is the go-to for bare-metal K8s right now? I’m looking at **Longhorn** or **Rook/Ceph**, but I'm worried about the learning curve for Ceph vs. the performance of Longhorn.\n2. **Decoupling the "Master" Node:** I need to move the Registry and NFS storage off that...	\N

Not production-ready at all.\n\n**What it does:**\n\nThe operator automates backups of StatefulSet persistent volumes by creating VolumeSnapshots on a schedule. You define backup policies as CRDs directly alongside your StatefulSets, and the operator handles the snapshot lifecycle.\n\n**Use cases I had in mind:**\n\n* Small to medium clusters where you want backup configuration tightly coupled with your StatefulSet definitions\n* Dev/staging environments needing quick snapshot capabilities\n* Scenarios where a CRD-based approach feels more natural than external backup tooling\n\n**How it differs from Velero:**\n\nLet me be upfront: **Velero is superior** for production workloads and serious backup/DR needs. It offers:\n\n* Full cluster backup and restore (not just StatefulSets)\n* Multi-cloud support with various storage backends\n* Namespace and resource filtering\n* Backup hooks and lifecycle management\n* Migration capabilities between clusters\n* Battle-tested in production environments\n\nMy operator is intentionally narrow in scope—it only handles StatefulSet PV snapshots via the Kubernetes VolumeSnapshot API. No restore automation yet, no cluster-wide backups, no migration features.\n\n**Why build this then?**\n\nMostly to explore a different pattern: declarative backup policies defined as Kubernetes resources, living in the same repo as your StatefulSet manifests. For some teams/workflows, this tight coupling might make sense. It's also a learning exercise in operator development.\n\n**Current state:**\n\n* Basic scheduling (cron-like)\n* VolumeSnapshot creation\n* Retention policies\n* Very minimal testing\n* Probably...	\N

The majority of this time has been spent in a DevOps/SRE-type role, where I mainly worked on Azure Pipelines templates and Terraform (I feel quite confident in Terraform now, I've already fixed a couple of tricky deadlock situations) for our AWS infrastructure (nothing crazy, basic services like S3, EC2, Lambda, and API Gateway). I rarely coded smaller parts of .NET applications or helper applications, and I also often automated tasks using PowerShell and Bash.\n\nActual post:\n\nI haven’t received my salary update yet, but I doubt it will be anything more than a 10% raise at best, plus one additional salary as a bonus. The past six months have been really rough due to deadlines, management chaos, and the AWS migration from legacy servers.\n\nI am considering switching jobs this year, as I have been with this company for almost four years. I have a good manager (he gives me exceptional performance notes), and I have a chill remote setup, but at the same time, I can see that, theoretically, I could earn 2–2.5x my current salary at my level of experience (according to the offers I see on job boards - at least theoretically in my area, I am not US based). I know that the market is in very rough state currently, even in my country but somehow there are still job postings\n\nThe point is that I suck at interviewing.

They do not solve the part that actually breaks production systems: crash safe side effects.\n\nThe moment your state machine sends an email, charges a card, or fires a webhook, you’ve stepped outside consensus. If the leader crashes after performing the side effect but before committing it, failover turns retries into duplicates unless you bolt on a second protocol.\n\nI kept re implementing that second protocol. chr2 is my attempt to make it explicit.\n\nmechanism:\n\n-deterministic apply context: application code receives block_time from the log header and a deterministic RNG seed derived from the previous hash, so replay produces identical state transitions.\n- crash safe WAL: entries are CRC’d, payload hashed, and hash chained. Recovery is strict, torn tails are truncated; mid-log corruption halts.\n- durable fencing for view changes: a manifest persists the highest view and votes using atomic tmp+fsync+rename, rejecting messages from zombie leaders after restart.\n- replicated outbox: side effects are stored as "pending" in replicated state. Only the leader executes them under a fencing token. Completion is recorded by committing an acknowledge event, so failover only re-executes effects that were never durably acknowledged.\n\nTrade-offs (because there always are):\n\nSide effects are intentionally at-least-once; “exactly once” requires sinks to dedupe using stable effect IDs.\nThe system prefers halting on ambiguous disk states over guessing.\nSome pieces are still being tightened (e.g. persisting client request dedupe state as replicated data rather than an in memory cache).\n\nRepo: https://github.com/abokhalill/chr2\n\nIf you’ve ever had “exactly once” collapse the first time a leader died mid-flight, this problem shape will look familiar.	\N

After about two months of self-study and research, I feel that the gap between academic research and real-world applications in CV is relatively large, and that the field may offer more specialized niches in the future compared to NLP.\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts or advice on this potential transition. Thanks in advance.	\N

I've made many small projects before while creating my homelab setup but I am looking for something more like actually creating my own tools.\n\nIm aiming for something that sits between developer and DevOps.\n\nI want to improve my coding skills and understand DevOps tools on a deeper level. I'm kind of sick of just using tools and not creating my own, if that makes sense.\n\nMaybe Im having the wrong take on these things, a comment I always get from older gen engineers is how much they learned when they had to create their own tools. So, I thought it would be cool too.\n\nI would be grateful for any guidance regarding this topic, if my thought pattern is incorrect I'm open to hearing what I should focus on instead.\n\n  \nSome additional context, Ive been a DevOps for 4 years and recently I have become unemployed and I want to start a project but everything I've seen online feels like I've done better versions of those in real production environments.	\N

The flow is: a user calls /cluster/register, the backend generates a cluster\\_id and a secret, creates a Keycloak client (client\\_id = conn-&lt;cluster\\_id&gt;), and injects these into the connector manifest. The connector authenticates to Keycloak using OAuth2 client-credentials, receives a JWT, and uses it to authenticate to backend endpoints like /heartbeat and /callback, which the backend verifies via Keycloak JWKS. This works, but I’m questioning whether Keycloak is actually necessary if /cluster/register is protected (e.g., only trusted users can onboard clusters), since the backend is effectively minting and binding machine identities anyway. Keycloak provides centralized revocation and rotation, but I’m unsure whether it adds meaningful security value here versus a simpler backend-issued secret or mTLS/SPIFFE model. Looking for architectural feedback on whether this is a reasonable production auth approach for outbound-only connectors in private clusters, or unnecessary complexity.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated, thanks. 	\N

Dropped out in 2018. 1.6 GPA. School was never a strong suit for me growing up.\n\n\\- No certifications. Tried focusing on A+/Network+ a year ago, but I didn't have the passion that I have now to follow through with either certification. Likely will obtain either or this year.\n\n\\- 7 yrs of experience in IT at my current job. Started off as a part-time helpdesk tech and got promoted into various senior level help desk roles focusing on different parts of our product's support/installation efforts. Worked in a NOC environment, field service/product implementation support, led and managed a team of help desk techs and even had a year of experience as a project coordinator. Current role is senior field service operations engineer (leading a team that supports our technicians who are sent out to install and troubleshoot our product).\n\n\\- Absolutely despise inefficiencies. At my current job, if I see something that can either be automated or streamline to assist my team and the customer, I try to pitch to to leadership and sometimes it's appreciated and it sticks. But honestly, most of the time I'm told to "get back to solving tickets".\n\n\\- I thrive in DIY/hands-on learning.

Our typical P1 takes 2-3 hours just to figure out what's actually broken - we're jumping between CloudWatch, Datadog, our deployment logs in GitHub, and trying to correlate what changed with what broke.\n\nI saw AWS announced DevOps Agent at re:Invent and it sounds almost too good to be true - like it automatically correlates all this stuff and investigates incidents for you? But I'm skeptical because:\n\n1. We have a pretty complex setup (multiple AWS accounts, microservices, the usual mess)\n2. I don't want to spend a week integrating something that gives me generic "have you tried turning it off and on again" advice\n3. It's in preview so I'm worried about stability/support\n\nFor those who've actually used it:\n\n* How long did setup take realistically and be actually useful?\n* Does it actually find root causes or just surface the same logs you'd find manually?\n* Is it useful for complex distributed system issues or just simple stuff?\n* Any gotchas with multi-account setups?\n\nOur on-call rotation is brutal right now and management is asking why our MTTR is so high. If this tool actually works, it could be a game-changer. But if it's just AI hype, I'd rather spend my time improving our runbooks.\n\nThanks for any real-world experiences you can share!	\N

Here's a summary of the blog: \n\n\n1. The AI Vibe Check \n\nThe "just add AI" honeymoon phase is ending. At KubeCon London, sessions were packed based on buzzwords alone. By Atlanta, the mood shifted to skepticism. In 2026, organizations will stop chasing the hype wagon and start demanding proof of ROI, better security audits, and a clear plan for Day 2 operations before integrating AI features.\n\n2. Kubernetes Moves to the "Back Seat"\n\nKubernetes is no longer the star of the show and is more like the engine under the hood. We’re seeing a massive surge in adoption of projects like Crossplane, kro, and Kratix. Platform teams are moving away from forcing developers to touch K8s primitives, instead favoring abstractions and self-service APIs. The goal for 2026: developer experience (DevEx) that hides the complexity of the cluster.\n\n3. The Death of Local Dev Environments\n\nLocal environments can’t keep up with modern cloud complexity or the speed of AI coding agents. The "slow feedback loop" (waiting for CI/Staging) is the new bottleneck. 2026 will be the year of production-like cloud dev environments. \n\n4. The "Specific" AI SRE\n\nWe aren't at the "autopilot cluster" stage yet. While tools like K8sGPT and kagent are gaining ground, we won't see general-purpose AI managing entire clusters. Instead, 2026 will favor task-specific agents with limited scope and strict permissions. It’s about empowering SREs, not replacing them.\n\n5. Open Source Fatigue\n\nOrganizations are hitting a saturation point with overlapping CNCF projects. In 2026, the "cool factor" won't be enough to drive adoption. Teams are becoming hyper-selective, prioritizing long-term maintainability, community health, and clear roadmaps over whatever is currently trending on GitHub.	\N

My current responsibilities:\n\n\\- manage the render farm for failing jobs/efficiency of renders, stuck frames etc\n\n\\- make sure the pipeline outputs clean data between different departments (layout/anim/lighting etc)\n\n\\-troubleshoot artists' broken anim/lighting scenes\n\n\\-patch bugs in code for artists tools\n\n\\-make plugins/scripts to make artist's life easier\n\n\\-a lot of babysitting artists so that they can log off on time at 5pm and not having to worry about their things breaking\n\n  \nMy plan to break into DevOps and eventually into MLops:\n\n1. study and pass the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Certificate\n\n2. learn about IOC (TerraForm)\n\n3. learn Docker and Kubernetes\n\n4. Apply for a devOps role (after 6-7 months of study and personal projects)\n\n5. If I get accepted, learn as much as I can\n\n6.While employed, go through [https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp) and apply it to personal projects \n\n7. Get MLOps related certs\n\n8. start applying to MLOps roles when I have \\~2 years of devOps experience\n\n  \nIs my plan feasible? are there are gaping holes?	\N

Naturally, many are rough drafts - far from being ready for publication. Some turn out to be things others have already done; some I talk myself out of; and others get shot down by my students. (Though, ironically, we sometimes see those 'students-do-not-like' ideas published at top conferences years later by other groups!)\n\nThat’s why I’ve decided to start sharing most of these early-stage thoughts more openly.

The goal is to have GPT-5 class accuracy with inference latency under 100ms. At my previous startup, we were building scheduled agents for which users could type a time schedule in English and we powered it with GPT-4; however, the input was quite slow and would only show options after you stopped typing. So after I quit, I had the idea of solving this overlooked problem using my ML skills!\n\nCron expressions are compact text strings used to schedule automated tasks to run at specific times on servers and computer systems. The syntax typically consists of five fields separated by spaces—`* * * * *`—which represent minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week respectively. Each field accepts various formats including wildcards (`*`), specific values (e.g., `30` or `MON`), lists, or ranges (e.g., `9-17`); for example, `0 9 * * 1-5` means "run at 9:00 AM every Monday through Friday."\n\n# Model Architecture\n\nCronformer leverages Gemma 270M as its pretrained backbone for language understanding. Capitalizing on the inherent independence of Cron fields, the architecture employs dedicated decoder heads—functioning as multi-label classifiers—to predict the values for each component separately.\n\nEach decoder component utilizes a pattern head to first determine the appropriate Cron syntax (e.g., a wildcard versus a specific value) for the target field. This decision dictates which subsequent classifier heads are employed to generate the final output values. To aggregate context from the entire input sequence, the model employs a custom multi-head attention pooling mechanism that condenses the variable-length token sequence into a fixed-size representation. This differs from standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA) by eliminating linear projections for keys and values; instead, learnable query vectors attend directly to the backbone's hidden states.

It claims to solve a large host of problems with joint embedding model training, and it had me thinking...\n\nWhat if you simply replace the discrete tokenizer used by LLMs with joint embeddings, and make your autoregressive language model, a "predict the next latent embedding"\n\nFor example:\n\n\\- Write some software to convert text to images where every 8x8 block (or maybe 16x16?) contains a character or whitespace. Can incorporate augmentations like jitter and font changes.  \n\\- Train a leJEPA VIT model on generated text "images" using SSL to create embeddings from these "images"\n\n\\- Freeze the leJEPA trained VIT embedding model, and use it as a frozen embedding layer for an autoregressive transformer based model that "predicts the next embedding"\n\n\\- With the embedding model and the autoregressive latent predictor frozen, train a decoder that translates embeddings into discrete tokenized text.\n\nI can see the following benefits:\n\n\\- No discrete tokenizer for input\n\n\\- Autoregressive latent predictor model *quickly* outputs full image scale concepts rather than individual discrete tokens and can be run asynchronously very quickly compared to the embedding -&gt; discrete text model\n\n\\- Cohesive multimodality built in... text-free images are still images that can result in latents, perhaps with finetuning on pure image datasets.\n\nIn my mind this would be more akin to how humans think - with far superior image recall than text sequence recall and thinking abstractly before speaking or typing language.	\N

For context, I originally used a MacBook for years, then switched to a ThinkPad and have been on Ubuntu for a while now. My current machine is an X1 Carbon 7 gen with no GPU, since all heavy training runs on a GPU cluster, so the laptop is mainly for coding, prototyping, debugging models before sending jobs to the cluster, writing papers, and running light experiments locally.\n\nI’m torn between two philosophies. On one hand, the MacBook seems an excellent daily driver: great battery life, portability, build quality, and very smooth for general development and CPU-heavy work with recent M chips. On the other hand, the ThinkPad gives me native Linux, full CUDA support, and the ability to test and debug GPU code locally when needed, even if most training happens remotely. Plus, you can replace RAM and SSD, since nothing is soldered likewise on MacBooks.\n\nI have seen many people in conferences with macbooks with M chips, with many that have switched from linux to macOS. In this view I’d really appreciate hearing about your setups, possible issues you have incurred in, and advice on the choice.\n\nThanks!	\N

I have my own research workstation with a few GPUs and do my own work. Since physicians typically don’t have the ML background I’ve noticed some of them keep coming to me “to ask questions”, not about how to install CUDA in Ubuntu or compile XYZ with gcc, but mainly architectural questions: “How should I analyse this? What model should I use? How do I use LangGraph? (really), etc.”\n\nI don’t mind helping out with very specific questions (pip vs uv; VS Code vs something else) but I feel that the questions I’m getting are more critical to their projects to the level of actual research collaborations and not simply “helping out”. Tiny example: When the PI told us we could get a brand new MBP, I came up with my own specs and they simply tagged along because they didn’t know any better. Not a single “Thank you”; not that I care, it’s just for context.\n\nHow do you guys typically handle this? When “being helpful” actually morphs into “being a co-author”? And how does one go about this? Just begin the conversation with “This is a collaboration, right?”\n\nTIA\n	\N

My goal was to leverage low-level optimizations to see just how much throughput I could squeeze out of the architecture.\n\nThe results are pretty wild. By focusing on cache locality and SIMD instructions, the new implementation is up to **10× faster in training** and **34× faster in inference** compared to the original FPTM.\n\n**MNIST Benchmarks (Ryzen 7950X3D):**\n\n* ⚡ **Throughput:** 4 GB/s\n* 🧠 **Inference:** 32M+ predictions/sec (98% accuracy)\n* ⏱️ **Training:** 1000 training epochs in just 11 seconds\n\n**Key Engineering Optimizations:**  \nTo get this performance, I focused on:\n\n* Extensive use of Bitwise operations and SIMD instructions.\n* A specialized, cache-friendly memory layout.\n* BitSet indexing over literals for handling very large, sparse binary vectors.\n* Automatic selection of UInt8/UInt16 TA states.\n* Model "compilation" to minimize memory overhead.\n\n**Why speed matters (Generative Tsetlin Machines):**  \nBecause this implementation is so efficient, it is now practical to explore generative tasks with Tsetlin Machines. I implemented a character-level text generator using FPTM with HDC hypervectors and Monte Carlo sparse context subsampling.\n\nHere is the raw output from the model generating text in the style of Shakespeare:\n\n    ROMEO:\n    The father's death,\n    And then I shall be so;\n    For I have done that was a queen,\n    That I may be so, my lord.\n    \n    JULIET:\n    I would have should be so, for the prince,\n    And then I shall be so;\n    For the princely father with the princess,\n    And then I shall be the virtue of your soul,\n    Which your son,--\n    \n    ESCALUS:\n    What, what should be particular me to death.\n    \n    BUCKINGHAM:\n    God save the queen's proclaim'd:\n    Come, come, the Duke of York.\n    \n    KING EDWARD IV:\n    So do I do not know the prince,\n    And then I shall be so, and such a part.\n    \n    KING RICHARD...	\N

The protocol is lightweight and explicitly designed for community replication (local inference via Ollama supported).\n\nI'd value feedback on:\n\n* Methodological strengths/weaknesses (e.g., proprietary prompt limitations, self-ranking biases)\n* Suggestions for more rigorous aggregation or statistical analysis\n* Ideas for extending the protocol in future iterations\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts on similar evaluation approaches or experiences with small-model fine-tuning trade-offs.\n\nThanks!	\N

I rarely use it to build actual features, so most of what I commit is still designed and written by hand.\n\nIn my company, this is a conservative position. Many devs have been opening pull requests full of AI slop - they can't explain the choices that were made or how stuff works, etc. \n\nI had two incidents happen last week that have left me convinced that credbility of human work is a casualty of the AI era.\n\nWon't bore you with details, but essentially in both cases people used LLMs to override code and decisions that I had carefully written and made by hand, introducing bugs and hurting the user experience. The idea that the code/UX was thoughtfully considered, *and should be reasoned about before changing*, seems to be increasingly remote.\n\nWorse, I think these devs were above doing that pre-AI. LLMs are allowing good devs to turn off their brain and make bad decisions.	\N

At the time I thought he was joking - how can I, a junior, even approach much less understand the code in the standard library.\n\nTurns out, after deepening my fundamentals, reading multiple of the canonical books, participating in open source and years of writing/reading code, I no longer feel the same fear to approach any codebase in my main languages.\n\n(Humble) bragging aside, in my experience to be able to *read* code effectively you have to know the language/runtime and most if not all the language features. And this takes a lot of time - in the hundreds to the thousands of hours. \n\nTime investment that's not always judged as practical by most developers. And to be honest, it mostly isn't - often you have some very opinionated framework and you are left developing more or less trivial code in lots of places. So they end up using and being comfortable with a very limited subset of patterns and language/runtime capabilities.\n\nNow, with the use of LLMs the same people have to read and evaluate a lot more code:\n\n* code that may use patterns they have not encountered before \n* code using language constructs they are only vaguely familiar with\n* code relying on some implicit runtime/framework behavior they are not aware of\n* code that's actually using subtle anti-patterns \n* code that's just wrong/hallucinated\n\nExpensive option would be to try to understand everything by prompting the LLM for explanations. However, they might have lots of blind spots, or just think they understand something they actually learned the wrong way. Of course, the LLM might just provide plausible but still misleading explanations - again only something an expert can discern. Unknown unknowns might surface that require a lot of extra-study... that's all very uncomfortable and is not helping very much for their current task.\n\nLess...	\N

Product orgs tended to be somewhere in between.\n\nThis also reflected in code quality inversely correlating with expected lifespan, sometimes to absurd extremes like thousands of LoCs of copypasta vs using loops and arrays.\n\nBusiness value alone does not explain this though. Surely you need some way to verify the implementation even for code meant to help put together a slide deck for a one-time presentation to some bigwig. \n\nAnd surely you need code meant to expire even with the most load bearingest core infrastructure, even if it's stuff like temporary logging that will only be relevant for a short time or purposefully shitty management scripts for handling some specific reoccurring issue that you want actually solved instead of letting it become part of the workflow.	\N

However, sometimes there are situations where someone gets pulled in on a project that is not in the major language of the company and then the company wants to move this app into their native language.  So in that situation the dev has to decide to either adapt or move on.\n\nWhat kind of factors do people take into account whether to make a jump from one tech to another, and how important would you say those factors are in comparison to one another?  I would suspect the job market would be a part of it and how healthy that is for the stacks in question, but lets say it is something like dotnet vs java spring.  Would it be wiser to for someone who has a decade in dotnet to swap to java spring to adapt with the company move or simply move on to another job that is in the same stack in the long term?	\N

Usually I create tickets with enough information since I’m usually the one that’s gonna work on them. \n\n\nFor context, and without doxxing, the project involves creating a system that builds for the future, and defines a clear interface in which our team is responsible for one part and another team will take ownership of the other part. We had a legacy system that made it hard to work with, but there are pieces of it id like to keep as they do work good. \n\nSo does the immediate work need to be the part we can make work with the legacy system and then after work on the refactor/rearcitecture? 	\N

The last two years have led to what is now an insufferable culture. Every single OKR involves AI. We’re being spammed every day across Teams Channels with posts from senior leaders with AI propaganda. It’s being asked to be implemented into products where it makes no sense at all. All of our learning workshops and our budget has gone towards AI. They’ve openly stated that our biggest problem is the bottleneck of code reviews and are looking to automate that.\n\nI’ve grown so bitter towards it mainly because it feels like we’ve entered the age of anti-intellectualism. We’re now apparently ecstatic that there’s no critical thinking required anymore. Hard-earned skills and knowledge are being democratized to people who quite frankly haven’t earned them. \n\nThis hurts because I’m a very driven person. I taught myself to become a software engineer without a degree. It took three years of nights and weekends. Been an engineer for another 3-4 after that. I’m constantly teaching myself new languages, libraries, and frameworks outside of work to expand my stack.

I had found out at the time that they 'fixed' their Y2K problem (their system was using 2-digit years) with a bit of a hack or maybe some would call it a workaround. \n\nIn preparation for Y2K, instead of modifying their system to use four digit years, they kept the 2 digits and then put in checks around if the date is X years difference, assume it's in the 1900's or 2000's. This logic was all over the code and any integrating system still used these 2 digit years.\n\nFast forward to 2026, I just met up with an old coworker that still works for this company. Turns out, nothing has changed. They are still using a 2 digit year with these hacks still in place. Surprisingly, they had even ported their software to a new language in that time, but kept the 2 digit year and all the hacks as-is.\n\nThis got me wondering...\n\n1. How much software is out there that still deals with 2 digit years with these kinds of workarounds? \n2. Do other developers run into this often?\n3. If so, have you experience anything catastrophic from it?\n4. For those who eventually fixed it properly, what was the catalyst?\n\n	\N

Early in my career I was very motivated and strongly believed that, by rigorously applying software engineering principles, I would eventually reach a solid level of control over the systems I was building. Clean code, logical models, separation of concerns: the goal was to reduce entropy as much as possible.\n\nIn the first years I made simple mistakes: I studied them, improved, and could clearly see progress. Over time, however, I started noticing a recurring pattern: there is always something that’s not quite right. Not necessarily critical bugs. Sometimes it’s a small UI detail, sometimes a requirement interpreted differently by the client. Each time you raise the bar, add more checks, learn, improve… but the loop never really ends.\n\nWhat I struggle with the most is not the request itself, but the feeling it triggers. Even when the work is objectively correct, when I’m asked to “fix” something — even a very minor detail — I experience it as a kind of micro-failure. Rationally, I know iteration is normal, but emotionally that request reopens something that, in my mind, was already closed.\n\nOver time I’ve also realized that much of the theory I once internalized as “law” is actually highly heuristic. Working under tight deadlines, on legacy systems inherited from others and poorly designed, theory only partially fits reality. The gap between the ideal and the real always remains visible.\n\nAfter years of thinking that I just needed to keep improving my skills, I’m starting to believe that a certain amount of chaos is intrinsic to the field itself. I’m not questioning the importance of professional growth — I’ll definitely keep doing that — but it seems to me that software, by its nature, never really allows for total control or a true sense of closure.\n\nDo you relate to this experience?\nDo you ever experience requests for adjustments...	\N

Has anyone successfully pushed for more autonomy in a setup like this? How do you raise it without sounding like you’re criticising them?\n\nEdit:\n\n\\- This is not a PR size issue.

I’d really appreciate some perspective from people who’ve been in similar situations :)\n\nRecently, my manager spoke to me about taking on more technical operations responsibilities, while still remaining part of the development team. The idea is to have a balance between development and operations, partly because I’ve already been helping on the operational side.\nAt the moment, this includes things like:\n\n- Investigating and configuring SWIFT / SEPA payments when there are issues\n- Monitoring situations related to card processing\n- Occasionally helping with client account openings or operational flows around them\n- Acting as a technical point of contact when something breaks or behaves unexpectedly in production\n\nThis is lile 20% of the operational work.\n\nThat said, my long-term goal is to grow primarily as a software developer. I don’t see myself staying in an operations-heavy role long term, and I’m slightly concerned about drifting away from hands-on development, slowing down my technical growth, or being perceived mainly as “the ops person” over time.\n\nFor those of you who’ve worked in hybrid dev / ops roles:\n\n- Did this kind of role help or hurt your long-term development growth?\n- What questions should I be asking before agreeing to this setup?\n- Are there boundaries or expectations you wish you had set early on?\n- Does this usually act as a stepping stone, or can it easily turn into a long-term trap?\n\nI’m not trying to avoid responsibility. I just want to be intentional and make a decision that aligns with where I want to be in a few years. ^^\n\nThanks in advance. I’d really appreciate hearing different experiences and advice.	\N

What I mean by that is that I have (in my opinion) instilled a really great team culture. We collaborate really well, PRs are handled quickly compared to before, we are working well at increasing test coverage, reducing developer experience friction, etc. Basically I am happy with what I have done to 'elevate' the team, and consider us a role model for how other teams in the company should perform (not to toot my own horn too loudly).\n\nHowever, I feel like I am still lacking in ability to lead and elevate the individuals. I ran a round of 1-on-1s but my feedback was all just 'you're doing awesome, keep it up!' (which is true, they are doing awesome). I'm not really sure how to even notice what areas need improvement. All I've really managed to do so far is keep track of each person's 'wins', so that we have some justification when pay reviews come around. Performance reviews here are just based on vibes, so I don't even have a competencies matrix to refer to.\n\nEssentially I'm concerned that under me my team will just stagnate as intermediates, without the required guidance to push them towards senior. I have worked under some really excellent seniors &amp; team leads in the past, and want to make sure I can be that for my team.\n\nMaybe you have a go-to checklist of things to cover in 1-on-1s? Perhaps there is an 'open source' competencies matrix that I can refer to? Any tips are much appreciated. 	\N

If you've started a meetup I'd really love any general advice on stuff like pitfalls, building a community of regulars, and other nuggets of wisdom.\n\nAppreciate any two cents people have to provide too.	\N

After nearly two decades working as a corporate lawyer, he taught himself programming using freeCodeCamp.org. Within two years, he landed a job as a software engineer at Google. We talk about: - How tools are making programming easier, but other parts of being a developer harder - How 2009 - 2022 was NOT a normal job market and how devs are adapting - "The purpose of communication is to be understood" and other lessons Zubin's learned over the years Support for this podcast is provided by a grant from AlgoMonster. AlgoMonster is a platform that teaches data structure and algorithm patterns in a structured sequence, so you can approach technical interview questions more systematically. Their curriculum covers patterns like sliding window, two-pointers, graph search, and dynamic programming, helping you learn each pattern once and apply it to solve many problems.

Let's kick off 2026 with a ton of announcements. We just launched Version 10 of freeCodeCamp's JavaScript certification, along with updated Python, SQL, and Responsive Web Design certifications that you can earn. We even launched our beta Spanish and Mandarin Chinese curricula. (10 minute announcement article with tons of data): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/christmas-gifts-freecodecamp-community-2025 2. Now you can learn Spanish on freeCodeCamp. We just launched our FREE A1 Level Spanish curriculum. You'll learn: pronunciation, introductions, numbers, and more. More than 200 steps are live now. ¡Aprendamos! https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamps-a1-professional-spanish-curriculum-beta-is-now-live/ 3. Over the holiday break I took my kids to Johnson Space Center in Houston. If you're in Houston you should absolutely go here. We visited the Mission Control center that NASA used during the Apollo missions to the moon. They also had an awesome multimedia experience created by Tom Hanks about this year's Artemis mission to the moon. This is an incredible museum. We spent 7 hours there. It wasn't particularly expensive. Just make sure you book tickets to mission control a few months in advance of your trip. 4. During the road trip, I re-listened to Guns 'n' Roses's entire catalogue. Which brings me to today's song of the week: the 1991 epic Estranged. The is maybe the most mature-sounding...	\N

It explores the critical distinction between static workflows and dynamic agentic systems, emphasizing how LLMs serve as a reasoning "brain" to decompose tasks at runtime. Through practical Python demonstrations, the course covers essential components like system prompts, tools, and memory, while also comparing architectural patterns such as Supervisor and Swarm.
